<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chI' class='c008'>CHAPTER I<br /> <br />HOME</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009' >For the first time in ever so long Mimi was rude!
She shoved, pushed, crowded, stepped on other passengers’
toes, jabbed them with her elbows. She
forgot that every other camper on the train was as
eager to be at home as she.</p>

<p class='c010' >For long minutes, Mimi had been poking her red-head
out the window and then pulling it in, to report.
A lady Jack-in-the-box, Sue thought.</p>

<p class='c010' >“That was Bristow. The next stop is B. G.”&mdash;“There’s
Howard’s house on the hill&mdash;only two miles
from there&mdash;I know, I’ve hiked it.”&mdash;“Ooo-ooh
we’re crossing the river into town&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class='c010' >At the first soft p-s-s-s of escaping steam and applied
brakes, Mimi leaped to her feet. This was the signal
to stampede the vestibule. Because she had more
“junk” to pick up, drop and pick up again, Mimi
was not the first to rush down the aisle, but by some
miracle of shoving and crowding and complete forgetfulness
of manners, Mimi was at the head of the
steps when the train pulled under the long shed and
stopped. Only the restraining arm of the flagman
kept her from diving off headlong before the train
came to a dead stop.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Careful, Miss.”</p>

<p class='c010' >But Mimi neither heard nor heeded. She was
searching the faces of the crowd&mdash;Sue’s mother,
Margie’s daddy, Miss Jane’s Dick&mdash;but her own
darling family, where were they?</p>

<p class='c010' >“Hello, Mimi&mdash;my child, you’re freckled.” “Be
seein’ you, Mimi”&mdash;“Goodbye”&mdash;“Bye.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi seemed rooted to one small spot under the
shed and all the happiness in the world was passing
around her and leaving her alone. What could be the
matter? Something dreadful must have happened!</p>

<p class='c010' >Then she saw&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class='c010' >A black coupe swung down the drive and raced
right up to her&mdash;as near as it could come for the
tracks, and stopped under a big sign which read, “No
Parking.”</p>

<p class='c010' >The gravel was still flying from under the wheels
and the dust was still making fitful little clouds when
the door popped open and Daddy jumped out. Mimi
remembered later that he did not even wait to open
the door for Mother Dear and Junior but let them
scramble out the best they could. Daddy came striding
toward her and scooped her up into his arms,
bundles and all.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I simply wouldn’t have a doctor for a Daddy,”
he was saying.</p>

<p class='c010' >And Mother Dear, quite out of breath from dragging
Junior at a rapid pace, was adding&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class='c010' >“We had to go by the Hospital and Daddy was
detained&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class='c010' >But none of that mattered in the least now. They
were here&mdash;the baggage was stowed away in the
back of the coupe. Junior was stretched out on the
shelf blocking any view out the back window&mdash;an
ideal place to pull Mimi’s hair or tickle her ear&mdash;and
Mimi, Daddy and Mother Dear were scrouged
up together as Daddy stepped on the starter.</p>

<p class='c010' >One long happy sigh escaped Mimi as she cuddled
down, and not two minutes ago tears were, well, not
quite in her eyes, but in her heart to say the least.
Mimi’s blue eyes were usually merry.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Psst, psst!” in her ear. Junior’s warm breath
against her ear. “Secret!” in a hoarse stage whisper.</p>

<p class='c010' >“James Sherwood Hammond, Junior,” in Mother’s
sternest voice as she glared at Junior. A booming
big laugh from Daddy who received the tail end of
Mother’s stern glance. He immediately swallowed
the smile and began asking Mimi about camp.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Did Sue’s ankle get all right?” Daddy wanted
to know. “Were there any stomach aches after the
big Sunday dinner we brought? What finally became
of Pluto?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Yes&mdash;No&mdash;No,” Mimi was answering. “Oh it
was too perfectly precious&mdash;all of it&mdash;and Daddy,
Mother Dear&mdash;I am an honor camper! See!” She
fished in her purse and held up the felt emblem.</p>

<p class='c010' >“And you are something else, too. Today you
are&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class='c010' >But stop&mdash;Mother scowled at Daddy over Mimi’s
head and would have put her hand over his mouth
if she could have reached it; wondering frantically
if it were harder for big boys or small boys to keep
a secret, she changed the subject swiftly.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Is Miss Jane very tired from having the responsibility
of you wild young things?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Not at all&mdash;she’s grand&mdash;wonderful. Next to
you Mother, I love her best of nearly any one&mdash;and
oh, Mother! She is&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class='c010' >Then Mimi nearly told a secret. She stopped herself
in time. Perhaps she would have gone on but
Daddy was turning in the driveway. At the first
sound of the car, Von, abandoning his watch on
the porch and forgetting the restrained manners of
German police pedigree, came bounding toward
them. Mammy Cissy was standing in the door grinning.</p>

<p class='c010' >The striped runners of wandering jew falling over
the edges of the hanging baskets brushed her hair as
she ducked under and her swinging arm almost
knocked a fern pot from its pedestal, for Mimi had
jumped on to the porch neither from the porte-cochere
nor the front steps. With Von barking boldly at her
heels, she had cut across the lawn and leaped on to
the porch to Mammy&mdash;Precious old Cissy, who this
instant hugged her close, and the next was holding
her at arm’s length saying:&mdash;</p>

<p class='c010' >“Lan’s sakes alive, Miss Mimi, yo sho is brought
home a good crop of freckles and this newfangled sun
tan both!”</p>

<p class='c010' >Then Daddy calling from the drive, “Here,
camper, help take your things in. What good is this
old land lubber with a bulging sea bag?”</p>

<p class='c010' >Daddy made such fun of things. He was unusually
entertaining today (Mother had told him to be).
While he and Mimi carried the things upstairs to
her room&mdash;her own room with its ivory furniture
and crisp swiss curtains tied back with green taffeta
bows&mdash;Mammy, Mother and yes, Junior too, had
disappeared. Daddy knew they were in the kitchen,
busy putting last touches here and there and lighting
candles&mdash;lighting candles in the middle of the day!</p>

<p class='c010' >“There,” Mimi said depositing the last load on
the cedar chest under the double front window. “Can
it be possible I smell food?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Quite,” answered Daddy catching her mood. “It
could even be probable, honey, that the nose tickling,
delectable odor assailing your nostrils is <i>fried
chicken</i>!”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi ran for the stairs. Before Daddy caught up
with her and took her arm, Mother’s voice halted her
rush for the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Mimi, wash that train dirt off. You and Daddy
both freshen up, for dinner is ready.”</p>

<p class='c010' >There was an excited undertone in Mother’s voice
that should have told her something special was afoot
but she didn’t suspect a thing until she and Daddy
went downstairs together and walked right into the
blue velvet portieres! The dining room was shut
off! Before Mimi could solve the puzzle Daddy
pulled back the curtain and bowed very low. This
was the cue for the music to begin. Mother, Junior
and Cissy in three entirely different keys were
grouped at the foot of the table facing her singing,
“Happy Birthday to you!”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi was speechless&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class='c010' >There was a white cloth on the table. She was
somehow aware of Mother’s good plates stacked at
Daddy’s place, of the good silver which caught the
candle light, and most of all of the big white cake in
the middle of the table with fourteen yellow candles.
Mimi knew without counting how many there were.
It was her birthday. She was fourteen! How could
she have forgotten?</p>

<p class='c010' >“I believe she really is surprised!” beamed Mother
very pleased with it all. “We put something over on
her once.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Sho she is,” exclaimed Cissy ducking to the
kitchen as soon as the song ended.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I nearly told,” commented Junior slipping into
his place and adding in the same breath&mdash;“Give me
the drumstick, Daddy.”</p>

<p class='c010' >There was a deep note of gratitude in Daddy’s voice
as he asked the simple blessing. He was thankful
to have his small family all together again. It had
been a long two weeks to Daddy without Mimi.
There were not many more days to have them all four
together at their own table. Daddy knew something
Mimi was yet to find out.</p>

<p class='c010' >While Daddy served the plates, Mother helped;
while Cissy hovered behind Daddy’s chair with hot
breads, while Junior clamored for both drumsticks
now instead of one, Mimi made a discovery. She
found a plain white envelope that was flat on the
table, hidden under her napkin. She hadn’t taken her
napkin up immediately as Daddy finished the blessing
the way she usually did. She was watching tiny
streams of tallow run down the candles and hoping
they would not spoil the cake icing; admiring the
snowy white cloth and Mother’s thin, etched glasses,
so different from the bare tables at camp and the
thick glasses and heavy china. Not that camp wasn’t
all right&mdash;No siree! But it was so grand to be home
again.</p>

<p class='c010' >“A-hem” said Daddy. He had finished serving
the plates and all eyes were focused on Mimi waiting
for her to rip open the white envelope.</p>

<p class='c010' >“It’s for me?” Mimi asked picking it up and turning
it over. No name, no anything&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class='c010' >“Look and see.”</p>

<p class='c010' >It was so thin and flat, it couldn’t have much in it,
Mimi thought as she tore the end open with scalloped
little pinches. When she ran her finger in the envelope,
it seemed empty. Then she shook it and
out tumbled a check. It was for more money than
Mimi dreamed existed.</p>

<p class='c010' >“For you, daughter,” Daddy said (and when
Daddy said “Daughter” she felt very grown-up and
dignified if a slightly snubbed-nose person with unruly
red hair and such merry blue eyes can ever be
dignified).</p>

<p class='c010' >The check instead of being payable to Mimi was
made out to Sheridan School for one year’s room,
board and tuition for Mimi&mdash;in full&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class='c010' >“But&mdash;?” said Mimi looking dazedly from Mother
to Daddy. She wasn’t old enough to go to college
and she had heard Mother say she did not approve
of Prep Schools when there were good High Schools
at home.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Daughter, Daddy is going away a year,” Dr.
Hammond said&mdash;“taking a leave of absence from his
practice and going to Leipzig, Germany, to specialize.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“But what will we do without you?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I was coming to that. You see, daughter, Mother
is going along with me&mdash;” Daddy reached over and
patted Mother’s hand. “And Junior is too small to
leave so we are taking him.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“But me, Daddy&mdash;what about me?” Mimi’s voice
was getting thinner and higher.</p>

<p class='c010' >“You, daughter, are going to Sheridan School.”</p>

<p class='c010' >For an awful moment Mimi was silent. No
Mother or Daddy for a whole year? She wished
she were too small to leave too. They wouldn’t leave
her; then without moving her lips she whispered
“Sheridan School.” The very words were healing
magic. How often with great longing she had said
them. “When I get big I’m going to Sheridan
School.” She wasn’t big yet, but fourteen is quite
a responsible age.</p>

<p class='c010' >She began to understand that the long looked forward
to “someday” would be September.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Of course, of course,” she burst out. Holding her
head high and her chin firm, and without the least
bit of quiver in her voice, she looked Daddy squarely
in the eyes, “I am going to Sheridan School!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chII' class='c008'>CHAPTER II<br /> <br />MISS JANE’S WEDDING</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009' >If Daddy’s office nurse hadn’t called and said that
he had an emergency case there is no telling when
the Birthday dinner party would have ended. Even
as the telephone rang and Cissy drawled, “Doctah’s
residence,” Daddy glanced guiltily at his wrist watch
and stood up.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Tell Miss Gould I’m on my way, Cissy,” and
that quick Daddy was gone.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi was off too, but out the back door, not the
front. She stopped at the buffet on the way out
taking an apple out of the fruit bowl.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Surely, child, you can’t eat anything else.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“No ma’am, it’s for King&mdash;I’m going out to see
him.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“King isn’t here, Mimi&mdash;he’s at the veterinarian’s.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“What for? Is he sick?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Nothing at all. Dr. Kirby wants a friend to see
him. Daddy will explain.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Dr. Kirby isn’t trying to sell King, is he,
Mother?”</p>

<p class='c010' >In the instant Mother hesitated, Mimi knew.</p>

<p class='c010' >“That’s entirely up to you and Daddy.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Oh,” said Mimi going on out the door toward the
stable. She had no word for Von who trotted at her
heels, only a pat on the head. Together they stood
before the empty stall; Mimi leaning against the rail,
Von pressing against her knees. No proud head nuzzling
against her shoulder, no welcoming neigh, no
pawing. Daddy wouldn’t sell King without asking
her; Mimi knew that, but King was a valuable horse
and Daddy might need the money to go to Germany.
He couldn’t take the horse with him. She couldn’t
take him to Sheridan&mdash;or could she? Boarding horses
out a whole winter was dreadfully expensive. They’d
have to do something with King. Wrapped in her
calculations and nibbling at the apple intended for
her pet, she wandered back toward the house and
upstairs to her room.</p>

<p class='c010' >There was very little breeze. The scent of honeysuckle
was heavy. She was full and tired and had no
inclination whatever to open her duffle bag and begin
putting things in place.</p>

<p class='c010' >“No wonder, I’m sleepy. It’s quiet hour by camp
time.” So saying she skinned her linen dress off over
her head, kicked off her sandals, stretched out on
her own bed and in two winks and no blinks was
sound asleep.</p>

<p class='c010' >Two hours later when Mother opened the door,
Mimi opened her eyes but she did not get up. She
rolled over on her stomach, doubled her knees up
and propped her head in her hands.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Could you stand another big surprise today?”
Mother asked, handing Mimi the afternoon paper.
The paper was turned inside out putting the Society
Page on the outside.</p>

<p class='c010' >“There,” Mother added, putting her finger on an
item.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi was too sleepy to hurry. She had to shift
her position to hold the paper and as she moved
leisurely she said to her mother:</p>

<p class='c010' >“I suppose it says the charming and ‘onliest’ daughter
of Dr. and Mrs. James Sherwood Hammond has
returned from an extended vacation at Camp Mammoth
Cave”&mdash;a big yawn&mdash;“and that her parents
were tardy at the train?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Hurry, Mimi. This is important.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mother, who usually had all the calmness and
poise a doctor’s wife soon acquires, was weaving her
hands like Zasu Pitts before Mimi focused her blue
eyes on the column.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Mrs. Josephine Herold announces the engagement
and approaching marriage of her daughter,
Alicia Jane, to Mr. Dick Donnell. The wedding
will be an event of early autumn.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Umph! That’s no surprise to me. I’ve known
it all day long&mdash;for sure,” said Mimi superiorly.
“Why, we even planned Miss Jane’s wedding for
her on the train this morning coming home.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“And what are her plans?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Well, I don’t know exactly,” Mimi had to admit,
“but we’re going to be in the wedding&mdash;all five of us
who were in Miss Jane’s hut at camp, and Miss Millie,
too. We told her we were.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“And where will the wedding be?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Oh, Mother,” laughed Mimi, “you sound just
like that silly old nursery rhyme about ‘Mr. Frog
went a courtin’ and he did ride, umphum’ saying
‘where shall the wedding supper be?’ and if I answer
like the rhyme, ‘way down yonder in a hollow tree,’
that could be true for all I know. I don’t care where
it is just so I’m in it.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“A church wedding would be frightfully expensive
for Mrs. Herold, I fear; and since Mr. Herold
passed away and Mrs. Herold had the house made
into two apartments, their present living quarters
are rather crowded. I wonder&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi did not know what Mother wondered until
they were dressed for the afternoon and had driven
over to Miss Jane’s. Mimi had wanted to go by the
tennis court for two reasons; to show off her improved
game and to see Honky and return his tennis racquet
he had let her take to camp. The way things turned
out she was glad she went with Mother Dear because
now she was in on the ground floor of all the lovely
plans.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mrs. Herold, Miss Jane, Mimi (who sat near
the open door to wave hello in case any of her friends
passed), and Mrs. Hammond were no sooner seated
than Mrs. Hammond, with that charming directness
of hers, came to the point.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Jane, my dear, Dr. Hammond and I are so grateful
to you for the splendid care you took of Mimi at
camp that I want you to let me do something for you.
You see, your mother and Dr. Hammond’s Aunt
Gay were in Sheridan together and that almost makes
us kin.” Mother was laughing and being her most
winsome. Mimi had turned from the open door and
was watching her Mother and listening intently.
“What I am trying to say, my dear, is, won’t you
and Dick marry at our house? It is so perfectly suited
to a simple home wedding, the stairs, the living room,
reception hall and dining room arranged as they are.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Why, Mrs. Hammond, I don’t know what to say.
I never heard of anything so wonderful! I love
your house! I’ve been in and out there all my life
and feel it’s partly my home, too. What do you
think, Mother?” she asked turning to Mrs. Herold.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Jane,” little Mrs. Herold had tears of happiness
in her eyes, “it’s your wedding and have it as you
please. It could be a beautiful wedding there&mdash;the
white columns and the floor plan. It always has reminded
me of the big house down on the plantation
where your father and I were wed.” Her voice had
trailed away to a soft whisper.</p>

<p class='c010' >Jane rose from her chair and sat on the needle
point stool at her Mother’s feet and leaned her head
against her Mother’s knees.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I’ll have to speak to Dick, Mrs. Hammond.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Only one thing I must add, Jane. We are closing
our house the middle of September. The doctor
has definitely decided to go to Leipzig. I have to
get Mimi ready for Sheridan. If you could move
the date up two or three weeks, say to the first
week of September, we could manage beautifully.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Everyone listening knew Mother Dear could do
just that, manage beautifully.</p>

<p class='c010' >That is how it happened that when twilight, September
the seventh, came, all the streets for three
blocks around the Hammond house were blocked
with cars. The driveway was kept open and cars
were rolling up to the porte-cochere to deposit wedding
guests, circling the back flower bed and moving out
again. Well dressed ladies in dainty summer frocks,
gay young things, well groomed gentlemen were
strolling up the front walk and lingering in the cool
shadows on the veranda until the music invited them
in.</p>

<p class='c010' >Inside the house there was more commotion and
excitement than on the outside&mdash;florist helpers, caterers,
two dressmaker’s helpers, who were serving as
maids, were putting last touches here and there. No
one was more important than Cissy. Even in the
years to come when her own Mimi would be a regal
bride trailing down the steps of this same old house
where Mammy had already seen two generations of
joy and sorrow, she would not be busier. There
was, first of all, the caterer from Louisville who was
“acting Frenchy and puttin’ on airs” and “bein’ an
abomination” to Mammy’s soul. Yellow Fanny, who
had helped Mammy on special occasions before, was
as nervous as a cat. The yard boy was dressed up in
a fresh white coat opening car doors and the front
screen door and at every possible chance slipping back
to the kitchen window to tell those in the rear of the
house what was going on out front. Fanny couldn’t
stay far from the window, and Mammy herself, as
eager as any one not to miss anything, would listen
intently and then declare she couldn’t do anything
with “so many distractions.” But she had done a
great deal. The furniture was pushed back in the
dining room to make room for the guests. There was
a pile of white napkins on the buffet, but every available
inch in the kitchen was stacked with plates and
there were rows and rows of tall thin glasses waiting
to be filled. Tiny rolled sandwiches, what looked
to Mimi like a tubful of chicken salad, beaten biscuits&mdash;and
most wonderful of all, the wedding cake,
tiers and tiers of cake with a miniature bride and
groom on top. The caterer knew it was a work of art
but it was Mammy in her new black uniform and
crisp white organdy apron and cap who, after the
ceremony, would carry it in with candles flickering,
place it in the center of the table and hand Miss Jane
the silver cake server.</p>

<p class='c010' >There was a green bank of luxurious ferns before
the living room fireplace forming an altar. Even
now, the florist’s helper was lighting the tall cathedral
candles on either side. The white satin stool for the
bride and groom to kneel on was placed just so. There
was a profusion of cut flowers everywhere. The delicately
turned bannister was wound with southern
smilax and a big white satin bow crowned the newel
post. Downstairs all was in readiness.</p>

<p class='c010' >Upstairs there was an orderly confusion. Mother
Dear seemed everywhere&mdash;keeping order where chaos
might so easily reign. She was the puppeteer behind
the scene pulling the central strings making
the wedding party act. There had been so many
things.</p>

<p class='c010' >Miss Jane had been ducky about having a rainbow
wedding. Nothing else would satisfy her five little
campers, who were now her junior (and only) bridesmaids.
She had chosen palest yellow for her gown
palest yellow highlighting the deep waves in her
golden amber hair and striking little sparks of fire
in her deep grey eyes. She had let her hair grow
longer since camp and it curled softly to her face.
Her gorgeous sheaf of sunburst roses added the perfect
finishing touch to the picture of a beautiful bride.</p>

<p class='c010' >Miss Millie had been more fun at rehearsals than
all the rest together. She always amused Mimi and
since camp Mimi knew she would never be able to
be around Miss Millie long without being happy
and gay. Miss Millie was not pretty, but in her
sweeping green dress she made a very dashing maid
of honor. To Mother Dear’s great relief she had
arrived with Miss Jane fully gowned and been smuggled
up the back way&mdash;one less to dress upstairs.</p>

<p class='c010' >The trouble lay with the five, and had from the
beginning. Even before the color-of-dresses-difficulty
arose, there was this matter of not being able to
divide five into pairs, and bridesmaids must saunter
down the stairs two and two. Mimi was positive any
deviation would ruin the whole wedding! Perhaps because
she was in the habit now of taking charge of the
five, or maybe it was to keep unpleasantness out of
anything connected with her wedding; at any rate,
Miss Jane settled the first dispute most tactfully.</p>

<p class='c010' >“But Sue,” she had said and Sue, flattered, had
heeded, “Sue dear I wanted you to <i>play</i> at my wedding&mdash;I
must have a violin and I had pictured you
in a blue bouffant organdy dress with your violin
under your chin, playing and facing me as I came
into the living room. My knees may be a bit wobbly
by the time I get my long dress down the stairs&mdash;if
I get that far without tripping&mdash;and I’ll need to
see you playing, ‘Here comes the bride, here comes
the bride!’”</p>

<p class='c010' >Who could resist Miss Jane? Not Sue&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class='c010' >Then Jean, who had been superior at camp because
she-had-been-to-camp-before, was meek and agreeable
because this was her first time to be in a wedding&mdash;the
first time for them all&mdash;at least the first grown
up time. Margie had been a flower girl once but she
was such a baby then that didn’t count. She and Jean
had thrilled over pink for their frocks and they were
to come down first. That coming down <i>first</i> had been
another matter. Dottie had to be convinced (she with
the logical mind and the determined-to-do-or-die
disposition) that she and Mimi should be second because
they were taller&mdash;start with the short girls and
work up to the tallest. If only Miss Jane were taller
than Miss Millie it would be perfect, but she wasn’t.
At this point Mother Dear had mentioned orchid
dresses and peace prevailed again.</p>

<p class='c010' >Now the dark days of running to the dressmakers
for fittings, and trying to stand still and not to yell
when a pin stuck, were over. Even the satin pumps,
which, to be alike, had had to be bought white and
dyed, had turned out successfully. Only getting the
dresses on and the pumps on remained.</p>

<p class='c010' >At the moment Mimi’s arms were stretched high
over her head, her hair was caught on something or
other, and she was wriggling and Mother was tugging
trying to get the orchid dress over her head and
down without messing up her hair.</p>

<p class='c010' >“There, we must hurry,” said Mother giving the
final jerk as Mimi’s head popped in view again.</p>

<p class='c010' >“If I can balance on these heels and don’t fall&mdash;why,
oh why, didn’t Mr. Zeigler finish them in time
for me to practice wearing high heels&mdash;oh, Mother
if&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class='c010' >And then she saw herself in the full length mirror
of the closet door.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Oh,” was all she could gasp at her radiant image.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Sue, ready for you,” called Mrs. Herold gently&mdash;“Reverend
McKenzie is here and we’re about ready.
You girls look so fresh and sweet.” Mrs. Herold
looked sweet herself.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Thank you,” from all five. They had brought
the ensemble idea home from camp&mdash;when one spoke
all spoke.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Now, run along, Sue&mdash;careful&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class='c010' >Sue met the pianist and soloist in the upstairs hall
and the three quietly moved downstairs.</p>

<p class='c010' >A&mdash;A&mdash;A&mdash;squeak, squeak, E&mdash;E&mdash;E&mdash;A&mdash;D&mdash;G&mdash;plink,
plink.</p>

<p class='c010' >The four girls giggled as they heard Sue tuning
her violin. Dottie put her fingers in her ears and
grimaced.</p>

<p class='c010' >At the first strain of Cadman’s “At Dawning” every
trace of grin disappeared. A strange quiet pervaded
the whole house. Voices hushed to a whisper, then
died altogether. Fans ceased fluttering&mdash;“When the
dawn flames in the sky, I love you&mdash;” The whole
assembly had caught its breath in a lover’s knot.</p>

<p class='c010' >The bridal party assembled in the hall&mdash;all but
Miss Jane. Her door was still closed. The minister,
Dick and his best man had remained downstairs
They were to enter from the dining room and Dick
would meet Miss Jane at the foot of the stairs and
give her his arm.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi gripped Dot’s arm.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Oh, my gosh, I forgot something,” she gasped in
a stage whisper. Leaving Dot to remark, “You
would” to thin air, Mimi caught her full long skirt up
around her and ran on tiptoes into her room.</p>

<p class='c010' >Bang went the cedar chest top against the window
sill. Out came two boxes to be dumped in vain in
the middle of the floor. Desperately Mimi grabbed
up her camp count book and holding it by the backs
shook the pages till they rustled against each
other.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I must find it&mdash;I must!” she repeated. She was
beginning to despair when a downy blue feather fell
out. Clutching it firmly between her thumb and forefinger,
Mimi headed for Miss Jane’s door.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Miss Jane, Miss Jane,” she whispered tensely,
turning the door knob as she spoke&mdash;“I have something
for you&mdash;you have to have it, please.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Come in,” Miss Jane invited as Mimi slipped
through the door&mdash;“What in the world?”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi held out the feather.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Here, Miss Jane. Stick this on you somewhere
for luck. It’s a blue bird feather I brought from
camp.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Luck?”</p>

<p class='c010' >Miss Jane smiled as if Dick were the only luck
she ever needed to be happy, but while Mimi explained
she stuck the tiny feather under the ribbon of
her corsage.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Yes. Every bride must wear:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Something old, something new,</div>
      <div class='line'>Something borrowed, something blue.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010' >And you see Miss Jane, that’s all of them. Oh, there
goes the music&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class='c010' >Before she finished talking, Jean and Margie had
started. As soon as they turned the landing, Dottie
and Mimi fell in to the measured step. Holding
their bouquets tightly against them and counting,
listening carefully for the accent of the music and&mdash;trying
to go slowly&mdash;the bridesmaids descended to
the living room. Their tiny high heels made prints
on the soft satin laid over the carpet. Everything
inside Mimi was singing with Sue’s violin and the
piano. Again her magic trail of beauty stretched out
before her. When the final triumphant cords sounded
and Miss Jane paused for one moment at the head
of the stairs Mimi almost ceased to breathe. It was
all too perfectly thrilling. Her Miss Jane could
have stepped out of fairyland.</p>

<p class='c010' >The ceremony, the reception and going away were
events of a dream to Mimi. She moved here and
there and yet had no part in it. She kissed the groom.
She shrieked with glee when she bit down on the
ring in her piece of wedding cake. She hugged Miss
Millie with the rest as Millie’s long arms caught Miss
Jane’s bouquet which she tossed over the stairs when
she ran up to put on her going away ensemble. She
threw rice and rice and rice. Then all too soon it was
over and the last car was disappearing down the
driveway.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mother and Daddy stood on the steps waving.
Mimi was between them a step below. She could not
see the long look they gave each other over her head
which meant that some day, not so very many years
away, their own daughter would be going down the
same driveway, a bride.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012' >Afterwards, Mimi wondered how they ever lived
through it all&mdash;cleaning up after the wedding, putting
slip covers over the living room furniture, packing
away blankets in moth proof containers, putting
linens in the cedar chest&mdash;the frenzy of shopping and
sewing&mdash;the packing.</p>

<p class='c010' >The nicest thing happened to Mimi during those
busy days. Mother bought a small new light-weight
trunk and gave Mimi her big wardrobe one. Mimi
had always wanted a wardrobe trunk but she hadn’t
hoped to have one of her own until she was ready
for college. In fact, she had already made up her
mind to take the big metal trunk out in the garage
and like it, but Mother was going to pack things in
it that could go straight to Leipzig without being
opened, except, of course, for the Customs. Mimi
kept the wardrobe trunk open in her room with the
hangers pulled out and every time another dress was
finished and pressed she hung it up and admired it.
It was fun to see it fill up. Mimi knew she was a
lucky girl to have six dresses; the peacock blue jersey
was new and so was the plaid wool. The orchid
organdy was, practically. It was such a grown-up
thing to pack. The long full skirt had to be looped
over the hangers twice. Such care had to be taken so
as not to crush the sash. The others were made-overs
but they did look nice. No one at Sheridan
would know them.</p>

<p class='c010' >“It seems foolish to put so much time on your
clothes when you will have to wear navy blue uniforms
like all the other girls in the Preparatory Department,”
Mother said. She was being sure that
Mimi packed neatly. She was having a terrible time
with her boots.</p>

<p class='c010' >“But there will be many times I can use them,
Mother.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I know and I want you to have plenty to last you.
I will be away, so far away, and so long&mdash;anything
could happen&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class='c010' >The quaver in Mother’s voice caused Mimi to look
up quickly. For a poignant instant they looked at
each other and then Mimi’s arms went around her
Mother’s neck. Tightly they clung to each other
and all the dread of parting, which each had been
choking back, rushed around them. Again mother
was holding her baby and, with all the self assurance
her fourteenth birthday had brought melted away,
a baby Mimi was clinging to her Mother.</p>

<p class='c010' >“There, there, child,” Mother was saying in a
steadier voice&mdash;Mother was so brave&mdash;“I must get
the rest of your underclothes. You polish your tennis
shoes so they will be dry enough to pack.” Mother
had gone quickly.</p>

<p class='c010' >That day the packing was finished and the trunk
snapped shut and Mimi hung the key around her
neck on a blue ribbon.</p>

<p class='c010' >That day, Mimi said goodbye to Von, to King,
who was being sent to the pasture for the winter, to
Honky, to the campers, to Cissy, and to her dear,
dear family. She couldn’t say goodbye to Miss Jane
for she was still honeymooning.</p>

<p class='c010' >And the next day, Mimi arrived at Sheridan
School. She was a day early, but Mother and Daddy
wanted her safely there before they left and they
were sailing soon now; consequently, she was the only
Sheridan student on the train. She was one more
than was expected apparently.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Heah you is, Miss,” said the Red Cap, who
bundled Mimi off the train&mdash;Daddy had given him
fifty cents and told him to “see after the young lady.”
The porter looked up and down the empty platform
and back at Mimi, “Shall I put you in a cab?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Yes,” Mimi answered the porter, trying not to
appear nonplused by not being met. “To Sheridan
School&mdash;Preparatory Hall,” she said aloofly to the
driver as if taking a cab was something she did every
day. That was the last time she ever said Preparatory
Hall. From then on it was Prep Hall.</p>

<p class='c010' >Though outwardly composed, Mimi was upset inside.
She had always imagined arriving at school
in the midst of a great hubbub, old girls rushing up to
greet you, new girls making friendly approaches,
chaperones taking your baggage checks. She knew
Daddy had wired Mrs. Cole, the matron. Here she
was alone in a taxi going no telling where! The taxi
had skirted the business district and turned off the
main thoroughfare. Mimi clutched her pocket book.
Suppose&mdash;no she mustn’t imagine such silly things,
but the papers were full of taxi hold-ups&mdash;last week
in Chicago&mdash;but this wasn’t Chicago. It was a sleepy
southern town&mdash;bump, bump, and just as Mimi was
about to convince herself that she was being taken to
a desolate wayside, the taxi turned right on to the
Boulevard&mdash;bump, bump, right again on to a long
winding gravel driveway. Leaning forward Mimi
made a mental picture of Sheridan School, the size
of the windshield. Between the winding rows of
deep-set pin oaks and frost-kissed maples, Mimi saw
the enormous red brick building with its three colonial
porches set at intervals, dividing the building into
sections called “halls.” The center point of the horseshoe
curve of the drive practically touched the concrete
steps of the central porch.</p>

<p class='c010' >The taxi stopped here and the driver blew his horn.</p>

<p class='c010' >Although there were many signs of activity&mdash;windows
open, mattresses airing, gardeners busy&mdash;it was
several minutes before the door opened and a very
flustered Mrs. Cole popped out. She was setting her
hat aright and buttoning the coat of her blue suit
as she came out.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Oh, dear, dear!” she was sputtering to the driver.
“I must meet that one-forty train.” All the time she
was speaking she was hurrying toward the taxi.</p>

<p class='c010' >“But Ma’am&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class='c010' >Then she saw Mimi&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class='c010' >“Why&mdash;” And Mrs. Cole’s eyebrows arched up
like a cat’s back and her whole face was one big question
mark.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I am Mimi Hammond,” Mimi announced calmly.
She adored being very cool and collected when other
people were confused. It gave her the most grown-up,
fourteen year old feeling.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I was going to meet you, child! Dear, dear,
what a day&mdash;everything upside down. I just this
minute found your father’s wire. Are you all right?
Here driver, take the bags to the last entrance down.
That is the Preparatory entrance. Come with me,
Mickey&mdash;I mean&mdash;what did you say your name
was?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Mimi.”</p>

<p class='c010' >She’ll have to stop eventually to get her breath,
Mimi thought. She bit her lips to keep from giggling.
In that minute she did three things: she liked
Mrs. Cole, felt sorry for her and knew by Mrs. Cole’s
apologetic manner that she had the upper hand of
her. As she followed Mrs. Cole down the corridor
to room 207, she was convinced that Mrs. Cole’s job
was too big for her. “She’s not a bit like Miss Jane
or our camp director. I bet they keep her because
they hate to fire her,” Mimi was thinking.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I’ll put you in here for the time being&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;Mimi.”
She had the name at last.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Thank you.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“You’ll have to get along the best you can the rest
of the afternoon. The supper bell will ring at six-thirty
and you be there.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mrs. Cole didn’t say where the dining room was;
she didn’t say a lot of other things that Mimi discovered
for herself that sunny autumn afternoon.
The campus paths, the friendly trees, the inscription
on the corner stone:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>“<span class='sc'>SHERIDAN SCHOOL, DEDICATED TO CHRISTIAN</span></div>
    <div><span class='sc'>PIETY AND FEMALE EDUCATION.</span>”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010' >All informed her. The lonely corridors rang with
her echoing footsteps. Once she glanced around
quickly, as if a dainty hand had patted her shoulder
saying, “Don’t be lonesome&mdash;we’re here.” She
wondered which rooms they had lived in&mdash;great
Aunt Patricia, Auntie Gay and Mother Dear.</p>

<p class='c010' >The great dining hall with only one of so many
tables set for supper did not bewilder Mimi. The
faculty members who had been arriving all afternoon
did not awe her. They rather ignored her or looked
bored as if to say, “Can’t we have a last fling without
a student butting in?” Mimi sat next to Mrs.
Cole at the end of the table. Of all the faces about
her, one in particular stood out. It was fresh and
the voice was crisp and vigorous. From that supper
time on, Mimi loved Miss Bassett, the physical education
teacher who still remembered her school days
at Sargeant and planned things the girls enjoyed.
She had the knack of making fun out of work.</p>

<p class='c010' >“You needn’t be afraid to stay in your room by
yourself, Mimi. Several of us would hear you if you
called out. I shall be up early myself. Run along
now and write your parents.” When all else slipped
her mind, Mrs. Cole said, “Write your parents,
dears.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi intended to. She located her fountain pen,
dusted off the study table, but then she pulled the
curtain back to let the breeze in and saw the harvest
moon rising full and splendid from behind a dark
bank of clouds and treetops. She rested her red head
on her arms and gazed up at the moon as a seer would
gaze into a golden crystal. What lay ahead of her
here at Sheridan? Sometime later she picked up the
pen, wrote a few feverish impressions into her new
diary and, putting on her gayest new pajamas, went
to bed.</p>

<p class='c010' >She was awakened next morning by hurrying feet,
excited voices. Over night the corridors had come
to life. Some Magic had peopled the cave-like halls
and summer-musted rooms with an ever increasing
number of chattering girls. Mimi had slept through
breakfast, a thing she would not be permitted to do
again unless she were ill, and the arrival of the station
wagon which had met the first train.</p>

<p class='c010' >Which of those strangers would be Mimi’s roommate?
How she wished one of the campers could
have come to Sheridan, too! “I do hope I get somebody
peppy and cute!” Mimi wished aloud as she
finished putting on the plaid wool dress and started
to the office of the registrar.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Freshman?” one of the most attractive girls Mimi
had ever seen asked as she entered the office.</p>

<p class='c010' >“No&mdash;Prep.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Sorry,” the girl replied, and turned to another
“lost sheep” and asked the same question. The new
girl answered, “Yes.” The attractive girl took her
in charge immediately. Mimi looked after them.</p>

<p class='c010' >“That inimitable, incomparable creature of the inferior
species,” said a sassy voice over Mimi’s
shoulder, “is Elizabeth Lewiston, known to her fellow
inmates of this particular prison as ‘Dit.’ She
is a Senior in the College, Physical Ed major and assistant
to Miss Bassett.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi already loved Miss Bassett and from afar
she adored “Dit” the entire year.</p>

<p class='c010' >“What oracle do I thank for this information?”
Mimi turned to her informer to size her up.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Ah! Charming! You understood&mdash;comprehended&mdash;savvied,
in other words. I’d feared my
comprehensive vocabulary was past your feeble comprehension
and ’tis not!”</p>

<p class='c010' >By now Mimi was laughing, but the girl, whom
Mimi never heard speak the entire year without making
some one goggle-eyed at her vocabulary, continued:</p>

<p class='c010' >“You have the honor of addressing Olivia Pendleton,
near-child prodigy, who this year with a straight
A card, God wot, shall graduate from the Sheridan
Prep. Yo&mdash;a&mdash;a Sheridan&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I’m new,” Mimi replied but she felt neither new
nor strange as, arm in arm with Olivia, they went
from hall to hall, room to room, visiting and getting
acquainted. Olivia seemed welcome everywhere in
spite of her bookwormish appearance and Mimi was
welcome with her. In fact, many other new Preps
took it for granted Mimi was an old girl; she seemed
so at ease and was smiling and saying hello to every
one. Friendliness was natural with Mimi, and her
sunny disposition plus adaptability and independence
developed by her camping experience made her
popular immediately.</p>

<p class='c010' >That evening when all the girls new and old, college
and preps alike, gathered in the spacious, historic
old parlors for a get-acquainted rally, it was only
natural that Mimi be in the center of the group of
new preps. Mimi knew so many cute yells and songs
and she plunged into the task of teaching her group
a yell with characteristic enthusiasm. The old preps
had centered around Betsy Buchanan. Betsy, till
now, had been their undisputed leader. She was a
striking looking girl of perhaps fifteen; her short
brown hair was slicked back from her forehead making
a peculiarity about her eyes more noticeable.
She had one blue eye and one brown eye, and the
thickest, curliest eyelashes imaginable. Mimi had
admired her all afternoon but hadn’t met her. She
looked questioningly toward her now. Mimi could
feel a crisis. There was always a shaky feeling in
the pit of her stomach when something vital was about
to happen. She felt that way now.</p>

<p class='c010' >Steadily she returned Betsy’s look.</p>

<p class='c010' >Olivia pulled Betsy’s sleeve, forcing her attention.
“Let’s give a locomotive for the new girls.” Betsy
repeated, “Locomotive for the new girls&mdash;One, two,
three.” The cheer went up.</p>

<p class='c010' >For answer Mimi drew the heads of the new girls
closer to her and in a stage whisper had them repeat
after her a long yack&mdash;yack&mdash;yack, ending in a sky
rocket for the old girls. Twice they rehearsed it.
“Pitch your voice low&mdash;make it snappy&mdash;now!
One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class='c010' >Another yell went up.</p>

<p class='c010' >As Mimi jumped up in the center of her group and
flung her arms up wildly to end the sky rocket, she
saw something she couldn’t believe&mdash;a short plump
girl with a weekend bag in one hand and a violin
in the other was standing in the hall with Mrs. Cole.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Sue!” Mimi gasped. “Sue!” and dived through
the crowd. As she ran she had shed her worries about
a roommate. Here was Sue and what could be more
perfect! She did not dream she was racing to a disappointment.
She did not know that Betsy was glad
she was gone.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIV' class='c008'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <br />FOLLOW THE LEADER</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009' >“You’ll <i>love</i> our room, Sue!” Mimi was saying as
she relieved Sue of some of her luggage as they
trailed Mrs. Cole’s swishing serge skirt toward Prep
Hall. Styles could come and styles could go but Mrs.
Cole’s dark gored skirts with tails and her white shirt
waists would be at Sheridan forever. “Mrs. Cole
wears a uniform, too,” a last year’s girl had already
informed Mimi.</p>

<p class='c010' >“How did you manage to get here? Why didn’t
I know? How could you keep from telling me?’</p>

<p class='c010' >“Honest, Mimi&mdash;I didn’t know&mdash;I’m pinching
myself to see if it’s I; that I’m actually here in the
flesh. I’m scared to death I’ll wake up and be back
in B. G.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Tell me before I go mad and bite myself!”</p>

<p class='c010' >“The folks decided I’d do more with my music
here. Mother isn’t very well. My honorable male
parent made some quick money in the stock market.
I heard Mother telling him plenty about that, although
they don’t know I did. Oh boy, was it good?
Mother said it was gambling of the worst kind.
Father said she must listen to reason. Finally in
desperation he offered her half of it and Mother took
him up and scared him sure enough. ‘All right, I’ll
take it&mdash;I’ll take it and&mdash;and&mdash;send Sue to school!’”</p>

<p class='c010' >“What an inspiration!”</p>

<p class='c010' >“That’s all it was, I’m sure. She had been talking
to your Mother on the telephone, saying goodbye or
something and talking about how happy you were
going to be here. I know that just popped in
Mother’s head. But Father took her up on it. Whatever
miracle it was, I’m here. My uniforms won’t
get here for a week.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Handicapped by bundles, they hugged each other
the best they could.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mrs. Cole turned and spoke to them.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Young ladies, don’t make public displays of your
emotions.”</p>

<p class='c010' >The parrot-like way she said it, Mimi knew she
had laid that law down a thousand times. She looked
at Sue and said, “Br-r-r” and made motions of turning
her collar up.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi slowed up at 207 but Mrs. Cole kept right
on.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Excuse me, Mrs. Cole, but here is 207.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Well?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I am in 207.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Yes, goodnight, Mimi. Er&mdash;er&mdash;Lou.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“My name is Sue, Sue Hawkins.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Yes, yes, Sue dear. This way. I am putting you
in 321. It is a single room and I hope you’ll like it.
Your reservation came in so late.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“But Mrs. Cole&mdash;” Mimi had not stopped at 207.
As soon as it dawned on her what was happening she
hurried after them. “Mrs. Cole, please, Sue and I
want to room together. I don’t have a roommate.
You see we are both from B. G., and we know each
other. We were in camp together this summer.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Our parents would want us to be together,” Sue
took up Mimi’s desperate appeal.</p>

<p class='c010' >“My dears, we have a policy here at Sheridan that
new girls from the same town are not allowed to room
together their first year. It breeds homesickness and
cliques&mdash;we want neither. Next year if you still feel
this way, we’ll see. Besides, Mimi, you have a roommate.
I have assigned Clorissa Madison to 207 since
supper. The adjoining room is full now. You may
come with us, if you wish, and help Lou&mdash;er, I mean,
Sue, unpack.”</p>

<p class='c010' >There was nothing further Mimi could do&mdash;not
then. As soon as she and Sue closed the door of
321 behind Mrs. Cole, they put their heads together.
Sue looked disgustedly at the narrow room.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Even if I can’t room with you, I won’t stay in this
room. I’ll go home first!”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Forget it for tonight. Fix up and go back down
to the parlors and meet some of the girls. I want
to get back to 207-209 and see who has moved in. I
am in a suite, the only one in Prep Hall, and if I don’t
like the other three girls I may envy you this single
room. Go on down and I’ll join you later. In the
meantime I hope to ‘scum a scheme.’”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi was so absorbed that she absent mindedly
turned in the open door of 209 and stumbled against
a trunk in the dark. The hall light shown in through
the open door on the name painted across the end
in white letters&mdash;<i>Betsy Buchanan</i>.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Whew!” Mimi whistled between her teeth.
“Now that’s something!” She had wanted the
cutest and the peppiest in her suite but this was more
than she expected. Delighted as she was she felt
strangely uneasy. Mimi backed away from the trunk
and into the hall instead of cutting through the bathroom
to 207. Here again she stumbled, another
trunk tagged <i>Clorissa Madison</i> blocked her way
again.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Clorissa Madison,” Mimi said aloud and the
sound was pleasing to her. “I wonder which one of
all that mob downstairs is you, Chloe?”</p>

<p class='c010' >She turned toward the parlor to find out.</p>

<p class='c010' >Even as she arrived Chloe faded into the background
of her mind. The scene had changed since
she left. The college girls, instead of being grouped
by classes as they were when she left, were massed
in one large group. The new preps who had clustered
so eagerly around Mimi had joined the old preps.
Betsy was standing in front of the whole group giving
directions.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi watched from the edge of the crowd. Betsy,
she knew, had what it took&mdash;pep, poise, and that innate
gift of leadership.</p>

<p class='c010' >Between the end of the last yell and the singing
of Alma Mater, Mimi was conscious of lowered
voices behind her. Two faculty members strolling
through the hall had paused to listen.</p>

<p class='c010' >“The Buchanan girl is a born leader,” one of the
voices said.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I am too,” Mimi wanted to answer. Instead,
she resolved to show them. “Actions,” Cissy had told
her so often, “speak louder than words.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chV' class='c008'>CHAPTER V<br /> <br />TUMBLE INN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009' >Under ordinary circumstances Mimi would have
liked Chloe. If Sue had not come she might even have
chosen her from all the Prep students for her roommate.
Chloe was exquisite to look at&mdash;shining black
hair, wide dark eyes which were never looking
squarely at you but beyond you; slim hands with
shapely well cared for nails. She was sensitive and
shy and lived way down inside of herself somewhere.
It seemed strange to Mimi to have slept in the same
bed with a girl, to run in and out of the same room
a whole day and not exchange more than a dozen
words with her. If Mimi couldn’t be friendlier than
this she shouldn’t have been an honor camper. The
two girls were dressing for supper, it was supper at
Sheridan every night but Friday; then it was dinner
with candle salad (pineapple with a banana standing
in the hole topped with a flame colored cherry).
Betsy was stirring around in the bathroom humming
“Sheridan, My Sheridan.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Chloe,” Mimi began. She couldn’t stand the
reticence any longer&mdash;“Do you want to change roommates?
Don’t you like me?”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi didn’t get to finish then for Sue popped in.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Uniforms!” she gasped. “You look swell!”</p>

<p class='c010' >“We do at that, don’t we?” Mimi answered
pirouetting before the mirror. The plain dark-blue
dress with the white collar and cuffs was flattering to
Mimi and even more so to Chloe. White framed her
delicately carved face&mdash;you forgot the rest.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I’ll be glad when mine comes&mdash;I feel odd.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“You get to wear them long enough,” Betsy called
out.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Come on in,” Sue called. She was greatly impressed
with Betsy. She moved out of the chair and
flopped on the edge of the bed. But Betsy did not
sit down; she stood in the door combing her curly
hair.</p>

<p class='c010' >“The worst thing has happened to me. Laura
Lou Mitchell&mdash;last year’s most popular Prep&mdash;who
reserved this room with me last June is not coming
back. Mrs. Cole just told me. Gee! I was scared
to death when she sent for me. I thought, Oh, my
gosh! What have I done now? Believe me I was
relieved when she told me about the wire from Laura
Lou’s dad. Of course, I’m terribly disappointed.
The worst of it is I could have got Magdalene or
Lida or anyone I wanted.” Betsy did not say this
conceitedly. She was attractive, popular, and she
knew it but never, never, could she be called a snob
or overbearing. “They’re all signed up now. Mrs.
Cole is so cranky about changes. Anyhow, they’d feel
second choice now.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Chloe fastened the safety catch on her brooch, gave
her hair a final smoothing down and turned her eyes
away quickly. She knew about second choices. “It’s
just as if Mimi knew about me,” she was thinking for
the hundredth time. “But she doesn’t; none of them
do&mdash;I’ve never told a soul.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Say!” Sue exclaimed grabbing her head as if it
were hurting and rolling her eyes, “I’ve an idea!”</p>

<p class='c010' >“It must hurt terribly,” Mimi laughed, “but do
tell us.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Summoning all the nerve and courage I have, I
shall plainly and simply state my case.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Simply,” Betsy interrupted. “You sound like
Olivia already and I loathe the sight of the dictionary.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“’Scuse me for living,” Sue murmured, “I just
thought I had an idea.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Oh, come on,” urged Mimi.</p>

<p class='c010' >“O. K.; here goes. Betsy, if you can’t find anyone
else to room with you”&mdash;Sue hesitated&mdash;“you
might try me; you could do a whole lot worse.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Perfect!” Mimi clapped her hands.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Why, I’ll have to speak to Mrs. Cole about it.”
Betsy was used to choosing and not to being chosen.
When she saw Sue’s round happy face darken,
she added, “I hope she will let us; I believe we’d
get on!”</p>

<p class='c010' >The supper bell rang and Betsy was gone. The
minute Betsy turned her back, Mimi and Sue danced
wildly around the study table in anticipation, then
started down the hall. Chloe was left to turn off
the light and close the doors. Half way down the
stairs Mimi remembered.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Come on Chloe,” she called back. “Please excuse
us, but you don’t know how badly I want Sue with us.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Yes, I do,” Chloe answered quietly as the three
girls moved toward the dining room.</p>

<p class='c010' >One-half minute before heads were bowed for the
blessing Betsy stepped up behind Mimi.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Mrs. Cole says ‘Yes.’” She had to stand by
Mimi during the blessing and all but fly to her table
to be seated with the others.</p>

<p class='c010' >During supper Mimi was absorbed with the moving
plans. That “scheme” she had been “scumming”&mdash;Mimi
had picked up many of her unique
sayings from Cissy&mdash;was working on her again.</p>

<p class='c010' >Then, too, she was busy getting acquainted with
girls all over again. They seemed so different in
their uniforms.</p>

<p class='c010' >Since this was the last free night for some time,
Betsy had so many callers she could not help move.
Chloe had an art conference so it was Mimi who
helped Sue throw her things together and shut her
trunk. The janitor would bring it in the morning.
They felt like intruders when they butted Betsy’s
half-opened door wide open&mdash;they had no hands to
turn the knob. “Lazy Man’s loads” Cissy would
call them.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Landslide?” a caller asked Betsy.</p>

<p class='c010' >“No, my roommate.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“But I thought Laura Lou?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“So did I, but she isn’t, girls, this is Sue and you all
know Mimi by now I imagine. Red-headed people
always manage to be known.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Couldn’t be a dirty dig?” Mimi flushed.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Compliment,” Betsy replied.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Which end of the closet is mine?” Sue asked relieving
the tension.</p>

<p class='c010' >When Betsy rose to show her and to help, the
callers left.</p>

<p class='c010' >“As soon as Chloe comes home”&mdash;the suite was
already home&mdash;“we must have a family conference.”
Mimi wanted to get them together to explain her
scheme. “Sue, don’t unpack yet,” Mimi ordered.
“I’m going after Chloe.”</p>

<p class='c010' >She was gone leaving good-natured Sue who took
orders alike from Betsy and Mimi.</p>

<p class='c010' >“207-209 is called a suite,” Mimi was explaining
to her suite mates when she had rounded up Chloe.
“That’s wrong. It’s nothing but two bedrooms with
a connecting bath. The only difference I see in it
and the other second floor rooms is that we don’t have
to use the community baths. A real suite,” Mimi
assumed her fourteen-year-old manner of wisdom,
“has a sitting room as well as a bedroom.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I know it.” Betsy couldn’t have them think she
didn’t know what a suite was. “When father and I
were in Memphis at the&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I suggest we make this a <i>real</i> suite,” Mimi was
not to be interrupted. “Let’s move both double beds
in this room, it’s larger, and both dressers and fix the
tables and chairs in the other room. We can put
pillows on the trunks&mdash;that is your trunks&mdash;mine is
a wardrobe and I will leave it open flat against the
wall and hang a cretonne curtain over it, they will be
a sort of divan.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Grand!” from Sue.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I don’t care” from Chloe. The opinion of second
choices didn’t matter.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Let’s do it right now!” from Betsy.</p>

<p class='c010' >The next hour saw 207-209 transformed. Pictures,
scrapbooks, pillows, Betsy’s table lamp, Sue’s
violin and music cabinet made the sitting room quite
livable. Photographs, quite a clutter of them. The
best looking one was Jack, Betsy’s grown brother.
Mimi’s tennis racquet and Betsy’s tennis racquet were
hung crosswise on the wall, the way Mimi had seen
in pictures. The closet space was allotted, towel rods
and tooth paste spaces designated, the beds made.
Lots were drawn for bed fellows and Mimi and
Chloe were still together. Then again, numbers 1
to 10 were guessed for the bed nearer the window.
Betsy won. Sue was glad because she was a fresh-air
fiend.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Isn’t this much better?” Mimi asked proudly as
the four tired girls relaxed in their bright pajamas
in the living room.</p>

<p class='c010' >“It calls for a celebration,” Betsy agreed.</p>

<p class='c010' >So saying she opened her dresser drawer and
pulled out a large square tin box. “My treasure
chest,” she informed her suite mates. “Cake&mdash;a
date cake&mdash;I’ve been saving for a very special occasion.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Precious! Too precious!” sighed Mimi happily.
“Only one thing to make our plan perfect. A name
for the suite. 207-209 sounds too ordinary for anything
so grand.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Let’s call it Tumble Inn,” Sue suggested, licking
her fingers. “I wanted to name our hut at camp
that. I think it’s cute.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Not ritzy enough,” Betsy said, shrugging.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I like it,” said Chloe, who had spoken only once
or twice all evening.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Good!” Mimi said with an air of finality. “I like
it too, because that’s the way I came in last night&mdash;tumbled
in&mdash;and that will be the way we will get
in most of the time unless y’all are better housekeepers
than I.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“We got hut honors at camp <i>once</i>, Mimi,” Sue
remarked.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Yes, I know. Chloe, can’t you make us a card for
the living room door?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I’ll try,” Chloe answered. The way she said
it, Mimi knew it was as good as done&mdash;clever, neat.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi went to sleep with a smile on her face.
Tumble Inn was a nice place to live. She would
make Betsy like her. She would make Chloe like
her. She would like them so much they couldn’t help
but return it. Sheridan was nice, too. It would take
more than the hectic trials of Green Cap Week,
which began tomorrow, to change her mind.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVI' class='c008'>CHAPTER VI<br /> <br />GREEN CAP WEEK</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009' >Even though Mimi heard the announcement in chapel
that Green Cap Week began today, something had
to happen to her before she realized its significance.
She was hurrying down the hall to English. Classes
were under way and she was having a time finding
the different rooms and getting there on time.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Wait a minute,” Olivia said, holding out her
arms and blocking the door to the room. “Another
girl whose hearing is deficient, whose eyesight faileth.
Away, lowly one, and wash that powder off your face.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“What?” Mimi stammered incredulously.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Go read the bulletin board. Ever hear of Green
Cap Week?”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi couldn’t be late to English. She didn’t want
to get a bad start so she ducked under Olivia’s arm
into the classroom, only to collide with Betsy.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Trouble?” she asked Olivia.</p>

<p class='c010' >“A mere trifle&mdash;Miss Hammond hasn’t time to remove
her make-up.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Yes, she has.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I’ll be late,” Mimi protested. She could feel her
cheeks burning. Why hadn’t she collided with anyone
else in school but Betsy?</p>

<p class='c010' >“Be late, but when you do get here, your face will
be so bright and shining Miss Lipscomb may mistake
it for intelligence.” Betsy’s tone left no alternative.
Mimi turned in her most dignified manner and walked
toward the stairs. She did not run until she turned
the landing and was out of sight.</p>

<p class='c010' >Only last night she had been sure she and Betsy
would be friends and now&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class='c010' >In her confusion she opened the bathroom door
with such violence she almost knocked Chloe down.
Chloe was drying her face and Sue’s roly-poly figure
was doubled over the lavatory. She was still scrubbing.</p>

<p class='c010' >“What! Y’all too?”</p>

<p class='c010' >Then Mimi saw how funny it was. Going without
make-up was no trial for her. She used very little
anyhow. She only side-swiped her nose with a
powder puff on special occasions. But Sue couldn’t
set her hair! Chloe couldn’t put polish on her nails!
No rouge, no powder, no lipstick, no mascara for a
week. It would be much worse in College Hall than
in Prep Hall. Green Cap Week had started in College
Hall for the freshmen. In a year or so the Preps
had taken up this light form of hazing and applied
Green Cap Week regulations to all new girls regardless
of class. Mrs. Cole was constantly on guard for
fear they would overdo it. She heartily approved
of one rule, however. No college freshman or new
girl could leave the campus the entire week. Prep
girls never could leave unchaperoned. Thinking over
the rules, Mimi wondered if there’d ever be time to
go to town.</p>

<p class='c010' >Even Chloe smiled broadly before they hustled
back to their classes. About as well be a good sport.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi had recovered her poise when she dashed by
Tumble Inn between dinner and class time. Betsy
and two other old girls were there grouped around
the treasure chest finishing the date cake.</p>

<p class='c010' >“’Scuse,” Mimi apologized, “but I live here, too.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Glad you came.” Betsy’s tone made it evident
they were waiting for her. “I didn’t stop for my
mail. Bring it up, please. They will let you have
it. I have arranged with the girl.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I mustn’t let her see she is getting under my skin&mdash;I
mustn’t&mdash;I mustn’t,” Mimi gritted her teeth together.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Be a pleasure. Going by anyway. So long.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Oh Mimi,” one of the other girls called, “Since
you’re going that way, stop in 223 and pick up my
laundry and take it down to the maid’s entrance. It’s
all tied up and tagged.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“223? Just love to,” Mimi fibbed. They couldn’t
see her flushed face. They mustn’t know she was
teased. There were ruts and bumps on the trail now
but Mimi would forge ahead. Once she determined
to do something she kept at it doggedly. At camp
she had resolved to find the beautiful in life, and
where it was not, to create beauty. She had chosen as
her watchword, “Hojoni,” a Navajo word meaning
“trail of beauty.” In darkest moments she uttered
it prayerfully. As she turned in 223 she whispered
to herself, “Hojoni.” Gingerly she picked up the
soiled clothes tied up in a big bath towel and holding
them at arm’s length away from her averted
nose, fled down the back stairs and left them.</p>

<p class='c010' >She reached the post office just in time to have
the windows closed in her face&mdash;and there was a
letter in her box! It could be for Chloe but again
it could be from Mother Dear! All period she tried
to concentrate on the fact that “a straight line is the
shortest distance between two points,” but who could
focus her attention on geometry when she had been
humiliated? When she might have her first news
from home? The post office wouldn’t be open again
until three-thirty. How could she wait?</p>

<p class='c010' >Going to her first gym class helped, or she thought
it would.</p>

<p class='c010' >Getting out of her uniform and putting on black
shorts and a clean white shirt perked her up. Mimi
loved the freedom of gym clothes. She liked to
fling her arms, stretch her legs, to run and dance and
play. The greatest disappointment she had had so
far at Sheridan was the fact that there was no swimming
pool. Plans for the completion of a modern
swimming pool with lights beneath the water were
under way but that didn’t help Mimi this year. To
make up for not having a pool, there were macadam
tennis courts and an excellent hardwood basket ball
floor. Today she would find out about them and
from Miss Bassett! Dit might be there, too.</p>

<p class='c010' >Again Mimi was disappointed. Something besides
play was happening in the gymnasium. Girls were
huddled in the anteroom. Two doctors, two nurses
and half a dozen college seniors&mdash;yes, Dit was one of
them&mdash;majoring in Physical Education were busy.
Miss Bassett was here and there.</p>

<p class='c010' >“In line alphabetically,” she said as Mimi straggled
in. “New girls in anteroom to the left, alphabetically,
please.”</p>

<p class='c010' >When Miss Bassett spoke, people acted.</p>

<p class='c010' >“What is it all about?” Chloe asked Mimi. There
was something so appealing about her wide-eyed question,
Mimi put her arm around her. Chloe looked so
small and helpless in her gym clothes. Her legs
and arms were paper-white in contrast to Mimi’s
ruddiness.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Physical examination,” Mimi guessed, and she
was right. “I took one to get my medical card for
camp and it isn’t bad,” Mimi reassured Chloe.</p>

<p class='c010' >She was not half so composed as she sounded.
Daddy had examined her for camp. Hastily he had
run down the card, checking the contagious diseases
she had had&mdash;measles, mumps, whooping cough&mdash;writing
yes or no after questions about vaccination
and serums. He had thumped her chest a time or
two, pressed his ear above her heart. Laughing
heartily he had said:</p>

<p class='c010' >“Go to it, camper! Swim, ride, row&mdash;shoot the
works! Nothing the matter with <i>my</i> girl.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Daddy was so proud of his tomboy. Mimi sensed
this examination would be different, and it was.</p>

<p class='c010' >First a senior ushered you into a dressing room
where another senior was seated. The senior with
the fountain pen and stack of cards looked up at
Mimi&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class='c010' >“Last name first, please.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Hammond, Mimi.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Age?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Fourteen.”</p>

<p class='c010' >On and on the questions came. Mimi had to
think hard to remember all the answers. When the
senior handed her the card with instructions to take
it to the nurse in the next room, Mimi was not at all
sure she had answered truthfully.</p>

<p class='c010' >Here Mimi had a new experience.</p>

<p class='c010' >Suddenly the nurse struck a match quite close to
Mimi’s eye. She closed her eyes and flinched.</p>

<p class='c010' >“There. All over. Merely testing your reflexes.”</p>

<p class='c010' >She hadn’t known she had any.</p>

<p class='c010' >The nurse wrote on the card while the doctor
listened to her heart, thumped both her chest and
between her shoulder blades. Carefully he noted
her posture. She was weighed, height measured and
before it was over her footprints noted.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi had laughed about this. First, she had
stepped in a basin of water and then made wet tracks
like the ones she left in the hall when Cissy called
her to the telephone from the bathtub. One more
test and the examination was over. The last nurse
wiped the tip of Mimi’s finger with alcohol, stuck it
so skillfully that it did not hurt, and squeezed a drop
of blood on a small glass plate. Then wiping the
finger again she sent Mimi to her room.</p>

<p class='c010' >Sue was there before her, crosswise of the bed,
sobbing softly.</p>

<p class='c010' >Homesick, Mimi guessed. Then she remembered
the letter in Box 207. She ran all the way downstairs
and when she got it, it was for Chloe. She took the
letter back upstairs and put it on Chloe’s dresser.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Sue, honey, can I do anything about it?” Mimi
asked gently.</p>

<p class='c010' >“No,” Sue blubbered, “it’s done. Miss Taylor cut
my finger nails nearly to the quick so I wouldn’t
fray my violin strings and peck the keyboard and
now that old nurse sticks my middle finger. I know
my fingers will be so sore I can’t practice for days.
I hope I can’t!” She dabbed at her eyes with her
middy collar. “Whose letter?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“It is <i>not</i> Betsy’s. She didn’t have any and I am
glad! It’s Chloe’s. Say, we have to keep study hall
tonight seven-thirty to nine. I thought we stayed in
our rooms and studied that time like the college girls,
but we don’t. We have to sit at those desks in the
chapel. I’ll never live through it. Cheer up, Sue.
If I can sit still an hour and a half <i>every</i> night, you can
surely stand your fingers a little bit sore. What a
life!”</p>

<p class='c010' >What a life it was that week&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class='c010' >Since this was the last year Sheridan would have a
preparatory department, the old girls greatly
outnumbered the new; consequently, Mimi and Sue
flunkied all week long. They made beds, shined
shoes, swept rooms&mdash;thank goodness the maids swept
the halls&mdash;carried towels to the floor showers
and worst of all wore silly green felt caps all week.
They dared not take them off until lights out.
Sue’s hair was stringy and Mimi’s freckled nose
shone.</p>

<p class='c010' >Chloe got off easier. She kept every rule. Her
first waking thought was to put her green cap on.
She obeyed so meekly and was so shy the old girls
soon let her alone. They picked on Sue and hounded
Mimi. It was more fun to tease girls who resented
it and had to battle themselves to remain good sports.
Mimi felt like a martyr but she gritted her teeth
and bore the persecutions.</p>

<p class='c010' >This was a week Mimi never forgot. She completed
her schedule, became acquainted with her
teachers, tried out for soccer and tennis. Sue tried
out for orchestra and was assigned second violin.
Chloe began spending all her spare time in the library
or better, the art studio. Betsy tried out for the
same things Mimi did. She was good at them. Her
chances for soccer looked better than Mimi’s. Mimi
admired her skill, her sense of fair play. Only once
did her admiration waver.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi was stretched out on the window ledge in
the gym when she heard two girls talking below her
outside. She recognized Betsy’s voice immediately.
It was tense with repressed excitement. After
becoming interested in their plot, Mimi peeped over the
ledge and recognized Magdalene.</p>

<p class='c010' >“This has been the tamest green cap week I ever
heard of,” Betsy was saying.</p>

<p class='c010' >“It sure has and it ends tonight.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Wish we could stir up a little excitement. Don’t
you remember last year we rolled that trash can
down the stairs, nonstop flight from third floor to
basement, at midnight?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Do I remember? I’ve never heard such a clatter
in my life. It nearly scared me out of my wits. I
wasn’t in on it. I was one of the ones it awakened.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Oh boy! Did Mrs. Cole rave!”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I never shall forget how funny she looked with
that outing kimona wrapped around her and her
hair twisted up on kid curlers. She was a fright.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“She never did find out who did it.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Betsy, surely you can hatch up something as good
as that. Think hard.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I have thought of something better, only I can’t
think of anyone with nerve enough to do it.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Magdalene’s eyes gleamed. She was a nervous,
high-strung girl. She adored Betsy and would run
any risk to win favor in Betsy’s eyes. Betsy knew this.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Dare me, why don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Why Magdalene&mdash;you’d be afraid!” Betsy certainly
knows how to work her schemes, Mimi thought.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I would not! Name it and see!”</p>

<p class='c010' >Betsy lowered her voice until Mimi had to strain
her ears to catch what she was saying. She did not
get it all but she did hear “alarm bell,” “basement,”
and “midnight.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Because Mimi liked to play pranks herself, her
first thought was, Will that be a riot? It won’t
scare me. I’ll be listening. I’ll tell Sue and Chloe
and we’ll stay up for the fun.</p>

<p class='c010' >Then she saw more clearly what the plot was and
what its consequences might be.</p>

<p class='c010' >Evidently there was, somewhere about the building,
an emergency alarm. Betsy wanted Magdalene
to wait until the building was quiet and dark and
then set it off. Mimi remembered all the stories of
panic she had heard; how people jumped out windows,
trampled each other, fainted from fright.
Chloe might faint, and in spite of the resentment she
had felt toward Chloe for being forced on her, she
was beginning to love her. She loved her so much
she didn’t want her badly frightened. Poor Mrs.
Cole. She had had a miserable week getting things
organized and running.</p>

<p class='c010' >“What to do?”</p>

<p class='c010' >By the time Mimi had made up her mind that the
alarm must not ring tonight, supper was over and
she was seated in study hall. “I’ll ask permission to
speak to Betsy and tell her I know.” No. She
couldn’t do that. She wouldn’t have time to explain
all her reasons and Betsy might think she was a sissy.
Besides, she was afraid Betsy didn’t like her much
anyhow.</p>

<p class='c010' >Suppose she spoke to Magdalene? She didn’t
know her well enough to interfere. Suppose she told
Mrs. Cole? That would only get the two would-be
culprits in trouble. Mimi had already heard how you
received long campus sentences for even small offenses.
They might be sent home for this prank. Besides,
she couldn’t be a tattletale.</p>

<p class='c010' >Tick-tock-tick-tock&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class='c010' >The hands of the study hall clock were getting
around too fast. Before she chose her course of action,
study hall was over. Gathering up her books, which
had been open before her but unread, she started
after Betsy and Magdalene who were strolling down
the hall together.</p>

<p class='c010' >Dit detained her. She came striding down from
College corridor, one hand in the pocket of her big
white sweater with the green letter, the other holding
a list she was carefully scanning.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Mimi, you are on number one soccer squad and
number one tennis club.” Everything had a number.
“That doesn’t mean <i>team</i> but it means a good
chance. Report at two-twenty tomorrow.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Oh thanks, Dit. Thanks a lot.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Where’s Betsy?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Gone.” She and Magdalene had disappeared.
Mimi ran upstairs. She must find them.</p>

<p class='c010' >They were not in Tumble Inn. Sue, who was
brushing her hair one hundred strokes every night
paused long enough to say&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class='c010' >“Fifty-five&mdash;Betsy is spending the night with
Madge&mdash;I guess Mrs. Cole gave her permission.”
Then she changed her hairbrush to her other hand and
continued brushing&mdash;“fifty-six, fifty-seven.”</p>

<p class='c010' >So that was it. Madge’s room (Sue insisted on
calling her that) was on the third floor at the head
of the stairs. It would be easier to sneak down from
there. Perhaps she should ask Sue what to do.
But no, Mimi was a lot like the cat who walked by
herself. She could figure this out and act alone. If
she ran the risk of being caught out of her room after
light bell, and if her plan did not succeed she might
be caught and considered a plotter herself.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi tried to be natural as she undressed, cleaned
her teeth, and said her prayers. Chloe almost sat
on Mimi’s flashlight she had sneaked under her
pillow.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Chloe.” Sue sounded so lonesome in the darkness.
“Please, come sleep with me. I can’t go to
sleep by myself.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Move over and give me your warm place and I
will.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi didn’t stir until several minutes after she
heard Chloe’s bare feet patter across the floor. She
could get up now without disturbing anyone. Carefully
she eased up to a sitting position, then lifted herself
noiselessly to her feet. The bed springs squeaked
as she stood up and Mimi stood rigid listening. She
slipped into her felt slippers and bathrobe and, inch
at a time, opened the door.</p>

<p class='c010' >The hall was twilight dark&mdash;only dim lights above
the bathroom entrances. Staying close to the wall
she moved toward the stairs. She froze in her tracks,
one foot on the first step, as she heard a door close
softly and a whisper “sh-sh.” Then acting without
knowing why, Mimi hid in the bathroom and waited.
Peeping out she saw Madge and Betsy creep by, casting
goblin shadows against the wall.</p>

<p class='c010' >For a mad instant Mimi wanted to join them rather
than foil their plans. Then she decided to have some
fun of her own. She’d pay Miss Betsy back for some
of the insults she had endured during Green Cap
Week.</p>

<p class='c010' >Giving the girls a safe start she followed them
down, down, down to the basement. At the foot of
the stairs the two girls turned right and back. Mimi
ran on tiptoe left and back to meet them under the
stairs. She crouched down behind a large trash container
and waited. Betsy’s flashlight was playing
against the wall.</p>

<p class='c010' >“There’s the buzzer,” she whispered. “Give me a
minute to get back to the foot of the stairs so you
can find me by the light and so we can run.”</p>

<p class='c010' >The alarm buzzer was right over Mimi’s head.
She could reach up and touch it herself. But she had
decided on her course. Better to scare one girl or two
girls out of their wits, than turn the whole school
inside out.</p>

<p class='c010' >“O. K.” Betsy whispered tensely. “Let’er go and
scram!”</p>

<p class='c010' >When Madge’s thin white arm reached up, Mimi
grabbed her wrist and with her other hand she threw
her flashlight in her own face so that Madge would
know instantly she would not be harmed. “Steady,
steady,” she whispered.</p>

<p class='c010' >Madge did not cry out. All sound died in her
throat but Mimi could feel her trembling all over.
Mimi was thinking fast now. She extinguished her
light, and pulled Madge toward her.</p>

<p class='c010' >“What’s wrong?” Betsy called in a low tone.</p>

<p class='c010' > “Tell her&mdash;nothing&mdash;bell out of order,” Mimi
hissed in Madge’s ear.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Nothing&mdash;it won’t r-r-ring&mdash;must be out of fix.”
She was still shaking.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi couldn’t hear what Betsy said but she was
shoving Madge toward the stairs.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Go to bed. Not a word about me.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Y&mdash;yes,” Madge promised, running toward
Betsy and light.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi followed them as soon as she dared. Her
speed increased as she neared Tumble Inn. She was
almost safe when Mrs. Cole’s door popped open and
a light snapped on.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Who is it?” Miss Cole asked coming toward
Mimi.</p>

<p class='c010' >It was Mimi’s turn to shake with fright and she did.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Mimi Hammond, Mrs. Cole&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class='c010' >“What are you doing out of your room at this
hour?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I am sick at the stomach, Mrs. Cole, and I started
to go to the kitchen to see if I could find some soda
but I got scared.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi hadn’t known before she could fib so readily.
Once she started there was no stopping.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Don’t you know you shouldn’t prowl around the
building at night? Why didn’t you call me?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I’m not scared,” another fib, “and I didn’t want
to disturb you.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Come in my room now.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi followed meekly. Anything to keep Mrs.
Cole from going to Tumble Inn and finding Betsy
out. She was sure all along Betsy did not have permission.
She watched Mrs. Cole pry the top from
a box of salts.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I’d rather have soda water, please.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“This will do you more good,” said Mrs. Cole,
stirring vigorously. “Here, drink it.”</p>

<p class='c010' >What else could Mimi do?</p>

<p class='c010' >While the bitter taste was in her mouth she wished
she had let the alarm sound, that Mrs. Cole had been
scared worst of all. But as she finally closed the door
of Tumble Inn safely behind her, she knew that one
dose of salts was better than two girls suspended,
especially when one of them was Betsy.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVII' class='c008'>CHAPTER VII<br /> <br />AN ACCIDENT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009' >Things were happening thick and fast these days.
Classes and study hall were realities. Rainy weather
cut the soccer season short. Mimi, to whom the game
was new, stayed on first squad but did not make the
team. She was flashy and fast but she was used to
making goals with her hands and not her feet. Now
when basket ball practice started&mdash;and it did this
week&mdash;she would show them something. There had
been a long letter from Mother Dear from New York
mailed the day they sailed; a letter from Dottie with
all the B. G. Hi news. Mimi had answered Dot with
news that she was on the Prep tennis double team.
She omitted soccer. Dot didn’t play soccer anyhow.
The literary clubs had started rushing, placards of the
first artist concert were posted and six weeks’ tests
were beginning to bob up their ugly heads. Sue was
gaining weight, Chloe growing most distant, and
Betsy and Mimi continued to admire each other
secretly but antagonize each other publicly. Something
was bound to happen to break the growing tension.
Two weeks later it did.</p>

<p class='c010' >When Mimi grew up and looked back at her school
days, she knew that the scene of her most exciting
moments was the gymnasium. Here she yelled her
breath out, played her heart out, knew defeat as well
as victory. Here she was her best or her worst.
Basket ball meant more to her even than swimming.
You swam by yourself but basket ball depended on
the perfect timing and teamwork of your team mates
to whom you felt closer than any other group of girls,
ever.</p>

<p class='c010' >The first day the notice was up, Mimi reported for
basket ball. Strangely enough she and Betsy both
signed up for the forward berths. When Mimi saw
Betsy’s square, back-handed signature under her own,
she had a bad moment. Perhaps she should have
signed up for running center. She had played running
guard but Sheridan kept strictly to girls’ rules.
As guard she could not score and, being a good shot,
she wanted a position where she could prove her
ability.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi never forgot those first skirmishes. How
hard she tried to pass accurately, aim carefully, catch
the ball firmly and be light, sure, fast. Miss Bassett
was a splendid coach. She tried first one combination
and then another. Betsy and Jennie forwards, Mimi
and Jennie centers. Evelyn and Betsy centers. Matilda
and Mimi guards. She had let the girls choose
tryout positions but she wanted to be sure they were
playing where they would give the team most. Then
came the combination which clicked. Betsy and
Mimi at forwards together. Mimi made what appeared
impossibly long shots rather than pass to Betsy
under the goal. Betsy called loudly to guards and
centers for the ball and shot quickly from any angle
she received it rather than pass to Mimi. They looped
goal after goal.</p>

<p class='c010' >“How about that combination?” Miss Bassett asked
Dit while the girls rested. Dit was calling the game
and Miss Bassett had been studying the players from
the side lines.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Best yet,” Dit answered, tapping her forehead
thoughtfully with her whistle, “if we can get that
individual starring idea out of their heads and make
them play for the team.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Signal practice will do that,” Miss Bassett assured
her. She had taken individuals before and
welded them into a team that put, “team, team,
team” above everything.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Give them ten more minutes of drill and dismiss
them, please, Dit. I’m going to the office.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“All right, girls,” Dit said, and when she spoke
they listened closely. “We are going to practice pivoting
and shooting. Divide up quickly in two line, one
on either side the basket and let the leaders be as far
back as the first court line so that there will be room
to run and pivot before you shoot. Here I’ll show
you.”</p>

<p class='c010' >She didn’t need to show Mimi. She knew.
Nothing was more fun than catching a pass solidly as
she ran forward. Usually Mimi leaped forward to
meet the ball. Then with one foot rooted firmly,
she knew how to pivot away from the guard and let
the ball fly swiftly toward the goal. Mimi held her
breath those times when the ball would loop around
the edge of the hoop before it finally slipped through
the knotted string basket.</p>

<p class='c010' >Happily she trotted to her place. Today she
would show Dit how fast and accurate she really was.
She would show up better than she ever had. Out of
the corners of her merry blue eyes she saw Betsy
in the opposite line with the same determined look on
her face. The whistle blew. Thump, thump, thump
went the ball against the slick floor as the first passer
dribbled down the side line before throwing the ball.
Thud&mdash;the ball hit the backboard. A girl rushed in to
catch it before it hit the floor, ducking to keep from
colliding with the girl who had just shot. Two girls
more and it would be her time. Mimi was impatient&mdash;smack&mdash;she
caught the ball&mdash;thump, thump,
thump she was running beside it. Accurately timing
the speed of Betsy who was coming in fast she passed,
then as swiftly as her legs would carry her, she raced
toward the goal. She forgot everything in the world
except the fact that she must keep her eye on that
ball and catch it before it hit the floor. Betsy was
moving rapidly with the same idea, “keep your eye
on the ball.” Coaches have preached it year in and
year out since there have been coaches.</p>

<p class='c010' >Thud&mdash;the ball against the backboard again.
Mimi’s arms up to catch it&mdash;Betsy rushing away, arms
up from having shot&mdash;Whack!</p>

<p class='c010' >The two girls collide&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class='c010' >Betsy is knocked out. Mimi staggers back, her
hands covering her face. When Betsy moans she
drops her hands. The stunned feeling vanishes.
Betsy is hurt, badly hurt Mimi fears. While Dit dismissed
the girls, Mimi drops on her knees beside
Betsy. Betsy’s mischievous eyes are closed, the lids
fluttering slightly. Her face, usually so rosy and
animated, is white and still. Her short hair is stuck
to her head with perspiration. More than anything
in the world, Mimi wanted Betsy to open her eyes.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Dit, please, open both those windows,” Mimi
pleaded, choking back a sob. “Oh, Dit&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class='c010' >“There, there, Mimi. She’ll come around soon.
Here, bathe her face with this wet towel.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi lifted Betsy’s head to her knees and holding
it gently, she put the cold cloth on her forehead. A
lump was rising on Betsy’s temple. She flinched and
opened her eyes as Mimi unwittingly touched it.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Oh,” Betsy cried.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Take it easy, Betsy. You’re all right now. A
nasty bump. Here, Mimi, let’s help her up and get
her to her room. I’ve sent for Miss Bassett to meet
us there.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I can get up,” Betsy said weakly.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi lifted from one side and Dit tugged at the
other. Mimi avoided Betsy’s eyes. She hoped
against hope Betsy wouldn’t think she had done it on
purpose.</p>

<p class='c010' >Miss Bassett was waiting in the door of Tumble
Inn. Sue and Chloe were out.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Lie down, Betsy. There, now let me look you
over.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Miss Bassett bent her arms, arched her knees.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Nothing but a ‘goose egg’ on your head. Massage
it with Mentholatum, Mimi. Better rest until
supper.”</p>

<p class='c010' >When Mimi leaned over Betsy to rub her forehead
she felt a warm gush from her nose.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Why, Mimi!” Dit exclaimed. “Your blouse&mdash;blood&mdash;it’s
your nose.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Yes ma’am. It hurts!”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi sank down on the bed by Betsy.</p>

<p class='c010' >Miss Bassett was instantly alert. Light as her
touch was, it hurt fearfully. The blood was dripping
down her throat gagging her. Pains were shooting
through her head. She could feel her nose swelling.
What a sight she must look!</p>

<p class='c010' >“Fracture,” Miss Bassett pronounced gravely.
“Dit, go for Dr. Ansley. She left me a short time
ago for the Infirmary. Don’t be frightened, Mimi.
It isn’t serious. I don’t believe you’ll need splints
but we’d better let Dr. Ansley take a look.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Will I have to go to the Infirmary? Please,
please, let me stay here.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Please,” Betsy added earnestly. “I’ll take care
of her and keep things quiet.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Daddy never seemed so far away&mdash;Daddy with his
sure, skilled hands and his make-you-feel-better
manner. But Mimi was brave. She sat quietly in
the straight chair by the window while Dr. Ansley
worked on her. Betsy watched intently. She was
smiling at Mimi, her eyes saying, “good sport, good
sport, be brave.” Returning the smile, Mimi
swallowed the two capsules the doctor held out.</p>

<p class='c010' >The thing which hurt most was the slow realization
that she was out of basket ball for the season.
Some one else would play forward with Betsy.</p>

<p class='c010' >Betsy must have known her bitter thoughts, for
after the Doctor, Miss Bassett, and Dit had gone she
said:</p>

<p class='c010' >“I’d rather play forward with you than any one.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Knowing what the admission must have cost, Mimi
replied: “Me too, and now I can’t play at all!”</p>

<p class='c010' >“It’s my fault because I didn’t watch where I was
going.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I didn’t either.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I am going to do something nice to make up for
it.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi fell asleep wondering what it would be.
Nothing could be as precious as what she had lost but
Betsy had said it was nice and Betsy kept her word.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVIII' class='c008'>CHAPTER VIII<br /> <br />MIMI GETS A BID</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009' >Mimi blotted the page and closed her diary quickly
at the first knock on the door of Tumble Inn. She
felt her eyes with the back of her hand to be sure
there was no trace of tears. Never any time or
privacy to do anything, be homesick, or tell all your
troubles to your diary.</p>

<p class='c010' >The last few days since Mimi had been excused
from gym because of her swollen nose, she had found
time to get a few things done. She was up with all
her notebooks; had clinched every word of her Spanish
vocabulary, and today had written the following in
her diary. (Mimi always considered her diary a
person; a person to whom she told her secret joys
and sorrows.)</p>

<p class='c010' >Oh, Diary, there’s no one to tell but you how it
hurts not to be forward on the basket ball team. If
I wasn’t such a good player it wouldn’t be so bad but
I <i>am</i> good. I can dodge and pivot and shoot. Yes,
I know what I’ve resolved to do. I am going to spend
every spare minute of my free time in the gym at
goal practice as soon as they’ll let me. There’s always
room for a crack shot on any team. I’ll be one.</p>

<p class='c010' >Do you know what I’ve discovered? I must be kin
to Pollyanna. I have found several consoling things
about having a “busted snoot.” First place, I couldn’t
wear an “S” if I <i>had</i> made the basket ball team; no
Prep can. Those class numerals wouldn’t mean so
much&mdash;I’d always be explaining them after I got
home.</p>

<p class='c010' >Betsy must like me, Diary Dear. That first night
when I could not go to supper, she brought me her
dessert (oh me! I shall probably die wondering if
there is one “s” or two “sses” in dessert). Chloe
has been sweet, too, but she acts so strange. Every
time we are alone she acts like she wants to tell me
something and can’t. There is something queer about
her&mdash;Oh here comes somebody&mdash;No, it wasn’t; they
passed by.</p>

<p class='c010' >I don’t know why I don’t want any one to know I
keep you, Diary, unless it’s because some one might
try to find you and then I should die! It’s no fun to
have you if I can’t tell you my very insidest thoughts.
Sue is the only one who knows and she won’t tell.
Here’s the most private thing I have to say today:</p>

<p class='c010' >I am getting popular!</p>

<p class='c010' >I know it. The Delphians and the Ruskins are
both trying to get me to promise to join their society.
I don’t know what to do. I’m so thrilled to be asked
but the Ruskins want Sue and the Delphians want
Chloe and Betsy is already a Ruskin. I hate to see our
suite family split up. Maybe I won’t join either.
They seem silly, in a way; the Ruskins bragging on
themselves and slurring the Delphians and the
Delphians slurring the Ruskins and bragging on themselves.
But the pins are perfectly precious! Solid
gold with tiny pearls.</p>

<p class='c010' >There really is some one coming&mdash;</p>

<p class='c010' >“Anybody home?” Madge called at the door of
two hundred and nine.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Just me,” Mimi answered hastily hiding her
diary in the top drawer of her wardrobe trunk. “I’m
in the sitting room&mdash;Come on through.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi could tell Madge was upset. She was paler
than usual and her hazel eyes were unnaturally
bright. But she didn’t seem happy. Mimi felt she
was not up to hearing any bad news.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Are you keeping training?” Mimi asked.</p>

<p class='c010' >“No, I’m not that good. Oh, Mimi, since&mdash;the
other night, I’ve decided I’m not good for anything.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Don’t be foolish, Madge. Here try some peanut
butter on a graham cracker and forget it. Another
advantage of a swollen nose, I can eat and eat and
eat!”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I don’t want to forget it until I tell you something&mdash;then,
if you please, let’s both forget it. You
see, Mimi, I came to thank you for keeping me out of
a scrape. I didn’t stop to think&mdash;I never do&mdash;and I
can not take a dare; I simply can’t.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I can’t either,” Mimi admitted. “I don’t know
why I ever butted in, an excitement-eater like me,
but I did.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“And I’m so glad, so glad.” Madge pulled
herself together for the final confession. “Mimi,” she
said levelly, “I am in school this year on borrowed
money. I wouldn’t have come at all if I were not
going to graduate. Suppose I had rung the alarm
and they had caught me and sent me home? I would
hate myself the rest of my life.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I’m glad I butted in then. But let’s forget.
You&mdash;you make me feel like a heroine&mdash;and I’m
<i>not</i>!”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Yes, you are&mdash;you’re the grandest all around
sport in school&mdash;you and Betsy.”</p>

<p class='c010' >While she was in a confidential mood she continued:</p>

<p class='c010' >“Every one in Prep Hall is sorry you won’t be on
our team. Betsy is sorriest of all. She keeps going
around saying it was all her fault but she is going to
make up to you for it. She is&mdash;please, cross your
heart not to tell a soul. She wants to surprise&mdash;”</p>

<p class='c010' >But before Mimi had time to promise, Sue dashed
in to get her music, leave Mimi a candy bar and a
letter from Jean. Before she left for her practice
room, Chloe was home. She seemed quieter and
more occupied with her own thoughts than usual.</p>

<p class='c010' >So beautiful, Mimi was thinking as she watched
Chloe stare out the window, so perfectly beautiful
like a Magnolia or a lily or a tube rose; something
that darkens and withers if you touch it. Chloe’s
mother must have been beautiful, too&mdash;and what
about her father? All the girls knew about Chloe’s
family was that her allowance came from her Aunt
Marcia. Bad as they wanted to know, they did not
ask. Maybe her parents were divorced. Her
mother must have been so beautiful that men might
have kept on falling in love with her.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Guess I’d better go,” Madge said putting the top
back on the peanut butter jar. She had been eating
and hoping Chloe would leave as Sue had but Chloe
seemed settled for the afternoon. “Please, don’t
mention anything I’ve told you.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Certainly not.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Giving Mimi an impetuous hug she hurried out.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Isn’t she queer?” Mimi said to Chloe.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Kind of. Almost as queer as I am,” Chloe
answered quietly.</p>

<p class='c010' >“You, queer?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Don’t pretend, Mimi. You know I am. Someday
I’ll tell you about it and maybe you’ll understand.
Oh gee, I am supposed to be at meeting in chapel this
minute. All the Preps&mdash;</p>

<p class='c010' >“No one told <i>me</i> about a meeting.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Chloe colored.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Maybe it’s art students only. I’d keep quiet if I
were you. Be a lady of leisure while you have a
chance. If you were supposed to go and they call your
name, I’ll say you are excused.”</p>

<p class='c010' >By the time Chloe finished talking she had closed
the door and Mimi heard her join Olivia and
Gretchen.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Aren’t you lending your charming presence to
the gathering?” she heard Olivia ask some girl who
was evidently in a great hurry.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Certainly, I am. Who do you think called this
meeting?” The breathless voice was Betsy’s.</p>

<p class='c010' >So? Mimi figured. That “something nice” is
going to happen today. What can it be?</p>

<p class='c010' >Class officers had already been elected. Since the
Prep Department would end this year the seventy-five
girls in it had chosen to organize as one class. The
very first week of school they had done that and old
girls had carried president, vice-president, secretary
and treasurer with practically no competition. Maybe
they were going to give her a fruit shower or a fudge
feast.</p>

<p class='c010' >Whatever she guessed she was wrong. None of the
guesses were thrilling enough. It was something she
had been off and on unofficially but now she could be
officially and wear a white uniform on special occasions.</p>

<p class='c010' >Although the meeting time seemed long to Mimi,
her elephant’s-child curiosity prickling her ’til she
couldn’t sit still, it was short. It took Betsy five
minutes to have President Gretchen call the meeting
to order, to present her motion, have it adopted by
acclamation, and give a yell of victory.</p>

<p class='c010' >Standing by the open window, Mimi heard the
echoes of the fifteen rahs coming up from the chapel
ell. The ending blurred. What was it they were
saying?</p>

<p class='c010' >Soon she knew for the same yell was repeated outside
her door.</p>

<p class='c010' >She did not hear Betsy signal “one-two-three” but
the rahs were so low and snappy and lusty Mimi
knew Betsy was leading.</p>

<p class='c010' >Now she knew the ending. It was; “Mimi, Mimi,
M-M-Mimi!”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi’s merry blue eyes danced.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Shall we huff and puff and blow Tumble Inn
down or will you open the door?” Gretchen called.</p>

<p class='c010' >Before Mimi could answer the girls threw the
door open themselves and stormed in; all the Preps.
They piled on the beds, propped against the window
sills and the radiator. Olivia pompously mounted
the stool to the vanity and rapped the wall for order.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Madam chairman,” (this to Gretchen) “ladies and
Mimi, with regret I announce Sheridan Prep has,
for the season, lost a great forward. But even this
dark cloud has a silver lining. By this loss she has
gained a great cheer leader. Ladies, I give you Mimi
Hammond, a red headed pepper pot who, henceforth,
will direct your vociferations! Youzza!”</p>

<p class='c010' >Here Olivia paused for a deep breath and looked
at Betsy. This was a signal to begin the song. To
the clapping of hands and the stamping of feet the
Preps sang to Mimi:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The peppiest girl I ever knew</div>
      <div class='line'>She never comes a pokin’,</div>
      <div class='line'>If I were to tell you all the pep she had</div>
      <div class='line'>You’d think I was a jokin’.</div>
      <div class='line'>It’s not the pep of the pepper pod</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor the pep of the pop corn popper,</div>
      <div class='line'>It’s not the pep of the mustard jar</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor the pep of the vinegar stopper.</div>
      <div class='line'>It’s the good old fashioned P-E-P</div>
      <div class='line'>The pep you cannot down,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sheridan pep <i>Mimi pep</i> the peppiest pep around. Heh!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010' >“Mimi, we realize you can’t do your stuff in true
Terpsichorean style with that cotton in one side of
your nose, but do by some speech or symbol signify
your acceptance.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi hopped up on the stool beside Olivia. She
was grinning from ear to ear, wide mouth, bandage
and a carrot top.</p>

<p class='c010' >“At a precious place like Sheridan, I’d rather be
cheer leader than President! Thank you too much
for this honor. Olivia is right. ‘The spirit am willing
but de flesh am weak’ as my Mammy Cissy says
but I <i>can count</i> a feeble ‘one-two-three’ for y’all to
give fifteen for Sheridan&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class='c010' >That fifteen was never finished. Mrs. Cole
pushed her way in.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Girls!” Her voice drenched them with ice water.
“There are music lessons, and office work and college
classes going on around the building in spite of the
fact that the Preparatory Department seems to be
making a Roman holiday.”</p>

<p class='c010' >That was enough. She turned sourly and walked
out, the tails on her serge skirt flopping behind her
at every prim step. The girls scattered after her.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Did anybody say ‘kill-joy’?” Betsy laughed.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Not I!” Mimi declared. “Take more than a little
thing like that to take me down when I’m so thrilled.
Oh Betsy,” Mimi moved toward her, “you did it, you
did it every bit. You’re a good sport!”</p>

<p class='c010' >“What about yourself?” Betsy answered smiling.</p>

<p class='c010' >For an instant Sue thought they were going to embrace.
She was such a sentimental little piece she
hated “scenes” unless she was in them.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I am going to write Dot this minute,” Sue said,
“and it will be all over B. G. Hi two days from
now.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi wished the news would spread on to State
University where Walter, sophomore camp life guard
of the previous summer, could hear it. However,
she didn’t say so. She never mentioned Walter except
to her diary unless she was showing the pictures
in her camp count book.</p>

<p class='c010' >“At present, I have only one worry worth mentioning,”
Mimi sighed contentedly. “These bloomin’
Society bids. Betsy, forget you’re a Ruskin and tell
me what to do? I am thrilled to death they want me,
but to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth,
I don’t care a hang about joining either one of
them.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Be a Ruskin,” Sue interrupted.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Why a Ruskin? Why is it the one to join?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I don’t know, except&mdash;I’ve joined it.” There it
was out and she wasn’t supposed to tell until Friday.</p>

<p class='c010' >“You have!”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Please be a Delphian, Mimi.” Chloe spoke
quietly, but she was pleading. “I’ve pledged
Delphian.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“‘Divided we fall,’” Mimi quoted. “What does
that make me? Nothing, absolutely nothing. I won’t
join either!”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Good for you,” cried Betsy to their amazement.
“You’ll be the first Prep who ever had courage
enough to refuse. I am proud to know you. Whatta’
girl!” Then realizing she belonged herself she
added, “Not a word of what I said goes outside this
suite.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Not one word,” agreed three voices.</p>

<p class='c010' >It was their first four-sided secret. For the first
time they were close together.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi felt quite important and lady-of-the-worldish
as she sat down and wrote two notes of refusal.</p>

<p class='c010' >Sue found her pen. Chloe took the stopper out
of the ink bottle. Betsy offered two sheets and two
envelopes of her special stationery with the Sheridan
crest.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I’d better write it with a pencil first and then copy
it,” Mimi suggested. “Now just what does one say?”</p>

<p class='c010' >They went into a huddle. After much erasing and
scratching out and rewording, Mimi made two copies
of the following note. It sounded sophisticated and
mysterious. She really did not know what mysterious
was until later, when she found out about Chloe. But
not stating any reason for declining the bids seemed
very mysterious. Changing only the headings,
Mimi copied.</p>

<p class='c013' >“Dear &mdash;&mdash;:</p>

<p class='c014' >“You were so kind to ask me to join your splendid

  <h2 id='chIX' class='c008'>CHAPTER IX<br /> <br />CLORISSA’S SECRET</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009' >Clorissa’s “someday” to tell Mimi her troublesome
secret came sooner than either expected. The revelation
came about unexpectedly Friday night. It was
the surprise climax to an unplanned party.</p>

<p class='c010' >Study hall had not subdued the suite mates. They
were still excited over Mimi’s honor of being chosen
cheer leader and over the campus discussion Mimi’s
notes would cause.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi tried to lie still so that Chloe could go to
sleep. She could hear Sue and Betsy turning and
whispering. Then Sue spoke aloud.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I am going to get up. I have a bad case of something,
a cross between the heebie-jeebies and the
jitters. I’m naturally wild on Friday nights and
want to celebrate.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Believe I’ll get up, too,” Mimi whispered.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Let’s all get up,” Betsy said and they were all
four out of bed and tiptoeing to the bathroom by the
time she finished.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi with her hands in front of her, walked slowly
and slipped her feet along. She mustn’t run into a
door facing with that nose.</p>

<p class='c010' >Betsy fumbled for a match, checked to see that the
bathroom shade was down, and then lighted a candle.
Keeping the flame shaded carefully with her hands,
she dripped some tallow in the bottom of the bathtub
and stuck the candle in the thickening puddle.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Success!” she breathed as she withdrew her hands
and the candle stood alone.</p>

<p class='c010' >“What do we eat?” Sue asked. “I’m starving.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“No!” Mimi teased and almost giggled out.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Sh-sh.” Betsy warned. She had been to too
many such after-lights-out parties. Keeping quiet
was rule one.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Alas the cupboard is bare,” Mimi wailed, as she
stepped down from the side of the tub where she had
climbed to search the high shelf.</p>

<p class='c010' >“The treasure chest is empty, too,” Betsy lamented.</p>

<p class='c010' >“We do have some white sugar and some cocoa in
the sitting room,” Chloe remembered.</p>

<p class='c010' >“My kingdom, not for a horse, but for a cow! We
need only butter and milk to have fudge.” Sue had
them all giggling now. “Let’s make hot chocolate&mdash;sugar,
cocoa, water&mdash;not rich, but I could drink ink
with sugar in it.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Far be it from me to be a kill-joy, but, we have
no canned heat.” Betsy sounded hopeless. “Why
did we ever bring up food at all? I was hungry but
not ravenous until we talked about fudge. If we go
to bed now, and there seems nothing left to do, I’ll
be delirious with visions of fudge and sugar plums
dancing through my head. Oh me, oh my. My
mother had such hungry children!”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Fudge? Did you ask for fudge, ladies? You
shall have it. I finish everything I start,” Sue’s
eyes were round with excitement. “Dit’s roommate
keeps canned heat all the time and I am going to borrow
some.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Sue! You mean you’ll go to college hall?”
Betsy asked. That meant getting safely through the
intervening corridor and stepping in to the lighted
halls. The chances of being caught were great.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I’d walk a mile for&mdash;fudge.” Sue concluded.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I’ll go with you, then,” Betsy said. “Now if
we can get to the first floor-bath and luckily catch
some one we know well enough, we can hide in a
shower while she goes and borrows the canned heat.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Betsy certainly knew her way around.</p>

<p class='c010' >“If you all get caught I’ll die,” Chloe whispered
after them.</p>

<p class='c010' >“We won’t,” Betsy assured her. “Into the valley
of death strode&mdash;&mdash;” Betsy and Sue were out the
door.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Gee! I’ve been thinking about Daddy and
Mother so much since I got hurt,” Mimi confided as
she and Chloe huddled on the bathroom floor in the
dim light. “You’d love my Mother and Daddy.
They’re keen! My Daddy is the best doctor in the
world and Mother is a darling. When they visited
me at camp this summer all the girls raved over them.
Some of them who have cranky old ‘stick-in-the-mud’
parents, envied me.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I’d envy you any kind of mother and daddy&mdash;even
old fogies.” Chloe’s whisper was pathetically
small and lonely.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi didn’t know what to say. She wanted to ask,
“Where are your Mother and Daddy?” but somehow
she couldn’t. She reached over and squeezed Chloe’s
hand and continued staring ahead. Minutes passed
and Mimi could not find her tongue.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I believe I hear them coming back,” Chloe said.
Both girls stiffened and sat up straight.</p>

<p class='c010' >The door to two hundred and nine opened almost
noiselessly, then clicked to. Mimi and Chloe rushed
to meet Betsy and Sue.</p>

<p class='c010' >“We have it!” Sue could hardly keep from shouting.
“Not a whole can, but enough.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Sh&mdash;sh&mdash;” Betsy cautioned again. “We nearly
got caught. Oh Gosh! Mrs. Cole, of all people,
was over there. She stopped right outside the floor
bath door and talked to Virginia, I thought she’d
never go on. Whew!”</p>

<p class='c010' >Sigh of relief all around.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Now for the dirty work at the crossroads.”
Betsy said. “Chloe get the chafing dish. Sue, stuff
towels against the bottom of the doors into the hall.
Can’t have this larupin’ good smell oozing out. We’d
have half of Prep Hall in here, not to mention Mrs.
Cole. Mimi get to stirring, we’d better cook in the
tub. The light won’t show so plain.”</p>

<p class='c010' >The whispered instructions were carried out silently
and quickly. Five minutes after the daring visit to
College Hall, sugar and water and cocoa fudge was
boiling away in the chafing dish which stood in the
bottom of the bathtub. Mimi was stirring away,
foamy brown bubbles. She mustn’t let it boil over,
not waste a precious drop&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class='c010' >“Want a cup of water to test it?” Chloe asked.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Shoot no,” Mimi answered. “I can tell by the
way it boils when it’s done. When it begins to boil
heavy and the bubbles spit little balls, it’s ready to
beat. Can I wait or can I wait?”</p>

<p class='c010' >Betsy in the meantime had greased a platter with
cold cream.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I really feel like I’m at boarding school now,”
Mimi murmured happily as she continued stirring.</p>

<p class='c010' >“You’ll <i>know</i> you are at boarding school if Mrs.
Cole catches us and you get <i>campused</i>,” Betsy warned.
“What a divine smell!”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Look!” Chloe was pointing at the canned heat.
Her face was tragic. “It’s going out!” Slowly the
blaze flickered, flared up, and while the anxious girls
looked on, sputtered out.</p>

<p class='c010' >“There goes the old ball game,” Mimi whispered.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Not for me, I’ll eat it with a spoon.” Sue declared.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Never say die,” Betsy said. “It’s nearly done, I
know it is. Lift it up Mimi and we’ll finish it over
the candle. We mustn’t let it stop boiling. Here.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Dit has an electric perculator,” Sue volunteered.
“She’s made tomato soup in it. Why not fudge?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Don’t be silly,” Chloe said.</p>

<p class='c010' >“No,” agreed Mimi, “you’d better thank your
lucky stars you made the last trip safely. Besides,
the lights are out over there now.”</p>

<p class='c010' >After ten slow passing minutes of feeble boiling
over the candle, Mimi declared the candy finished.
The candle was about gone, too.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Pour it up, please&mdash;” Sue urged.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Control yourself, Wimpy,” Mimi teased Sue.</p>

<p class='c010' >After each girl beat and beat, the candy was poured
up, setting as it fell, spreading in circles which heaped
higher and higher to the center leaving a topknot.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Dubs on licking the pan.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Go to it, but no holes in the chafing dish please,”
Mimi cautioned, handing her the pan. “We might
want it again, sometime.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Betsy dried the nail file she had been scrubbing
and while the fudge was still hot, she cut it with the
file. Then spreading an oiled bread paper flat on
the floor she turned the platter upside down. Slowly
the fudge fell out.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Let’s eat one piece apiece now and let the rest
cool,” Mimi suggested.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Since I licked the pan, maybe I can hold off,” Sue
agreed, turning on a slow stream of water and putting
the pan to soak.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Knock on wood y’all, but we’ve had better luck
with our first after-lights fudge party than my great
Aunt Patricia and her crowd did.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“What happened to them?” Chloe wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c010' >“You know, my great Aunt Patricia, Pattie to her
chums, came here when Sheridan was a Seminary for
young ladies, I mean ladies. Did they have it easy?
Needle work, china painting, French and grammar.
Penmanship was a heavy course. Imagine! I’ve
heard Aunt Pattie tell what an enormous place Sheridan
seemed to her when Uncle Mose and her father
drove her up the drive in the family barouche. Prep
Hall was all there was here then. The rest of the
building has been added. She was being left all of
twenty-two miles from home. Think where my
Mother and Daddy are! Uncle Mose, the coachman
begged his little Missie not to forget him while she
was ‘getting edicated’ and her father kissed her
solemnly on the forehead and gave her a Bible marked
with daily readings.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“But what about the fudge party?” Betsy interrupted.
She knew all about the founding of Sheridan
and its growth from a small private Seminary
to a Preparatory School with college course added;
how it was outgrowing finishing school requirements
and, by abolishing the preparatory department all
together next year, would be an A-1 accredited college
for women. Not that Sheridan tradition bored her,
but tonight her main interest was fudge. “It’s cool
enough for seconds,” she added, as Mimi continued.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Aunt Pattie was full of fun. She didn’t do anything
bad or break any big rules, but she got plenty
of demerits.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Don’t we all?” interpolated Sue.</p>

<p class='c010' >“This night of the fudge party things were just
getting in full swing, when there was a rap on the
door. Some one snuffed the candle quickly. The
window was open and they hoped the smell would go
out. Each girl sat or stood as she had been, you know
like slinging statutes&mdash;and hoped that the matron
would go on. But she didn’t!</p>

<p class='c010' >“Aunt Pattie had all the demerits she could have
that term so she was scared stiff. In spite of all her
hopes the door opened and there stood the matron
holding an old timey oil lamp in front of her. The
hall proctor was close behind her. Before either of
them had time to make out any of the girls’ faces, the
suction sucked the light out. Aunt Pattie did some
desperate thinking and then did a desperate thing.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Knowing that if the matron succeeded in lighting
her lamp again they were all in for it, while the
matron fumbled for a match, Aunt Pattie crept toward
her on all fours. When her hair lightly brushed the
matron’s heavy skirt, she stopped. For one calculating
second she checked her bearing, then swift as a
shot and sure as a good marksman, she jumped up to
her full height knocking the lamp out of the matron’s
hands! Wide flew the oil, the wick, the base.</p>

<p class='c010' >“In the panic which followed the girls fled to their
rooms. Other than the girls who were hostesses to
the party, only one girl was caught&mdash;”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Not Aunt Pattie?” from three distressed voices.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Yes, Aunt Pattie.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“But how?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“When Aunt Patty went down to breakfast the
matron was standing in the doorway supposedly saying
good-morning to the girls but she was really playing
detective, or better, bloodhound. She had been doing
some desperate thinking, too, and had found an excellent
clue. Carefully she looked down on each girl
who entered. Not that one, nor that one. She was
about to despair when Aunt Pattie came tripping in,
in her flowered cashmere.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Pattie come to my office immediately after your
meal.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Aunt Pattie pitifully murmured, ‘yes, ma’am.’
She was dumbfounded.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“But how did she know it was Pattie?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“She had been sniffing each girl and when Aunt
Pattie passed she simply reeked of kerosene. When
she upset the lamp she had baptized herself in oil.
Scrubbing had changed her appearance but the smell
lingered.</p>

<p class='c010' >“What did they do to her?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Sent her home I think. Aunt Pattie always
avoided that part. She didn’t want me to know any
of my family had ever been kicked out.”</p>

<p class='c010' >The candle was out and the fudge had disappeared
miraculously.</p>

<p class='c010' >“We’d better get to bed, I expect,” Sue suggested.
Full and warm, she was ready to cuddle down.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I wish y’all weren’t too sleepy to hear about <i>my</i>
family,” Chloe said faintly. “You see, I’ve tried to
tell you so many times and somehow couldn’t. While
it is so dark and nobody is running in and out, maybe
I could tell you.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“See that’s it.” Mimi hated herself for thinking.
“She’s ashamed of them!” but she was the first to
say encouragingly&mdash;“Do tell us, Chloe. I’ll admit
I’ve wondered why you told about your Aunt Marcia,
so much and never mentioned your Mother and
Father.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I haven’t any,” Chloe said bluntly. There it was
out. Mimi felt her quiver. They were all crowded
together in a small circle, crossed legs touching.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Oh.” Three soft Oh’s again. What else could
they say?</p>

<p class='c010' >“You mean, they’re&mdash;dead?” Sue whispered.
Her tender heartbreak was in her voice.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I&mdash;don’t&mdash;know,” Chloe replied.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Don’t know if your own Mother and Father are
dead?” Mimi prayed that wasn’t rude. The question
had popped out of its own accord.</p>

<p class='c010' >“No. I don’t know. You see&mdash;”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Yes?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I was&mdash;kidnapped.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Chloe’s whisper left them paralyzed. Their excited
breathing rasped the silence. All the eager questions
died unspoken. Now that the ice was broken Chloe
was the calmest of the four. In her soft, lanquid
voice louder than a whisper, but much lower than her
usual speaking tone, Chloe lisped her heartbreaking
story. Telling it helped. She spoke easier as she
went along. When she had finished it was as if she
had unclasped an iron necklace and left her throat
free from choking bruises.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Aunt Marcia is not my aunt at all. She selected
me at The Home and adopted me. There is only one
incident I remember about my real family.</p>

<p class='c010' >“When I was very small, I couldn’t have been more
than three, I was playing under two big trees by a
big white gate at the end of a drive. Two men slowed
up in a touring car and watched me play, then drove
on. Soon they came back. The big one with the
tattooed arms jumped out of the car and grabbed me.
As he slung me over his shoulder like a sack of cotton
seed and ran for the car, I heard a shriek. My head
was hanging down over his shoulder bumping up and
down as the man, whom I later learned to call Fritzie,
ran. I couldn’t see very well, but I shall always remember
the blurred picture I saw. A beautiful lady
was running down the drive screaming frantically.
As long as I could see she kept holding out her arms
running after us and pleading. She must have been
my Mother. She must have loved me very
much.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Chloe’s voice died away.</p>

<p class='c010' >Not a soul moved. Even the raspy breathing was
stilled. The whole night had paused to hear Chloe’s
touching story.</p>

<p class='c010' >Chloe’s voice and girls breathed again.</p>

<p class='c010' >“The little man drove us miles and miles. Fritzie
put coveralls on over my dress. Threw my little
white shoes away and put sandals on me. The buckles
pinched. Then Fritzie took some big scissors out of
the car pocket and cut my hair off until I must have
looked like a little boy. When the little man put
Fritzie and me on the train he said, ‘So long Sonny.’</p>

<p class='c010' >“Then there was a time, I have no idea how long,
that I lived on a farm with Fritzie and a large slow
moving woman called Freida. Callers seldom came
but when they did I was hidden in the cellar.</p>

<p class='c010' >“After a time something happened. I don’t know
what but Fritzie and Freida packed up and left, leaving
me at The Home. I stayed there ’til that happy
day Aunt Marcia came.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“But why didn’t you tell the people at The Home
you’d been kidnapped?” Mimi asked.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I tried to once and the nurse said I’d had a bad
dream. Of course, I didn’t know the word kidnapped
and I remembered so little by then. I even had a
new name and didn’t know the old one. When I’d
say&mdash;‘two men grabbed me,’ the nurse would say,
‘there, there; no one is going to get you’ and move
on to the next child. You see there were so many
of us in The Home.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Once I tried to tell Aunt Marcia. I could tell by
her eyes she was scared but she turned it off as if I
didn’t know what I was talking about.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“She’s afraid some one would identify you and
take you away from her.” Mimi was shrewd.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I’ve thought of that. It’s awfully nice to know
somebody wants me, but I wonder all the time who I
really am. Sometimes I wake up in the night and
think I hear my real mother screaming.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“You are just you, honey, and that’s good enough
for us.” Mimi spoke for all three. “We swear we’ll
never breathe a word of your secret.”</p>

<p class='c010' >How could Mimi ever concentrate on geometry
again when she was living in the midst of an unsolved
mystery?</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chX' class='c008'>CHAPTER X<br /> <br />BETSY SPRINGS A SURPRISE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009' >Mimi and Olivia sat back to back under one of the
biggest trees on the campus. Each held an open
Spanish Grammar on her drawn-up knees. Each had
her nose between the pages.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I think I know the first five vocabularies now.
Ask me, Olivia.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Spanish or English?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“You say English and I’ll say Spanish and spell it.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“O. K. Here goes&mdash;the table?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“La mesa. L-a&mdash;M-e-s-a.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Every day?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Todos los dias&mdash;T-o-d-o-s l-o-s d-i (accent)-a-s.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Olivia kept on down the list and could not catch
Mimi on a single one. Then they changed and it was
Mimi’s turn to quiz. Olivia knew them all, too.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Guess we’re pretty good, huh?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Gee, we ought to be; it’s all review but, oh, those
verb forms! I hate to have to cram but I have to
think about Dr. Barnes mailing my grades all the way
to Germany and how terrible Daddy and Mother
would feel if mine weren’t good.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“You needn’t worry. You may not be an A or an
A plus but you’re an A minus or B plus easy.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Wish I could believe you.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“But you can. With my excellent ‘I. Q.’, intelligent
quotient if you don’t follow me, I can classify
people by their mentalities; predict such trivial
matters as grades.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“A-hem! All right, Miss Brainless Wonder tell
me when I’ll get an answer from a very important
long letter I mailed my Daddy one week ago, to be
exact.”</p>

<p class='c010' >The thought of that letter made prickles of excitement
up and down Mimi’s spine. She’d love to talk
to Olivia about it. She hoped she hadn’t broken her
promise to Chloe not to tell a soul, when she had
written it to Daddy. No matter what you cross-your-heart-and-vow-not-to-tell
you can always tell your
parents. Mimi was sure of that when she had written
Chloe’s tragedy to Daddy. She had felt better ever
since. Not that Daddy could do anything about it&mdash;he
was too far away&mdash;but again he might when he
came home. At least there was some one to whom
she could unburden when she couldn’t keep from talking
about the mystery another minute.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Bad habit I have acquired&mdash;talking to myself.
Mimi! Look at me. I’ve explained twice already
about the answer to your letter and you haven’t heard
a word of it. Atten-shun, please! Now, for the
third and last time, you will&mdash;”</p>

<p class='c010' >Before Olivia finished waving her arms around
and succeeding in clouding her eyes as if she were
going into a seance, Betsy came running toward them
from the gym. She ran easily and lightly, arching
her knees high. Her middy collar was streaming behind
her. Her socks had flopped down over the tops
of her gym shoes.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Guess what?” she panted.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Must be something grand the way your eyes are
shining.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Betsy’s one blue eye and one brown eye with their
frames of thick curly lashes always fascinated Mimi
but when Betsy was thrilled as she was now, her eyes
were the cutest things Mimi ever saw. “Hurry and
tell before I die.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Yes, before she with the carrot top is devoured by
her ravishing curiosity.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Jack, my big brother who graduated from Vanderbilt
last June, is coming to take me to Nashville to
the big Thanksgiving football game!”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi and Olivia jumped to their feet. Away went
the text books and away almost went Olivia’s shell
rimmed glasses. By throwing her head back, she
managed to balance them on the tip of her nose.
While she and Mimi joined hands ring-around-the-rosie-fashion
about Betsy, all three shrieked.</p>

<p class='c010' >“And that’s not all!” Betsy gasped when the three
had let off the first burst of steam. “I can invite a
guest and I’m asking you, Mimi&mdash;can you possibly
go?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Can I? Can a duck swim?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I mean, will Mrs. Cole let you without a written
permission?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“She’ll <i>have</i> to. Oh Betsy, I’ll be a wreck if she
won’t. Let’s ask her <i>now</i>.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Leaving Olivia to gather up the notebooks and
Spanish grammars, Betsy and Mimi clasped hands
and ran toward Prep Hall&mdash;up the steps two at a
time&mdash;knock, knock on Mrs. Cole’s door.</p>

<p class='c010' >“If she’s not here!” wailed Mimi.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi despaired that the door would ever open
and doubled up her fist to pound her impatience out
on the door before they gave up and left. She drew
back her fist. As it went forward it met thin air. The
door opened back before the advancing fist and Mimi
almost pummeled Mrs. Cole in the stomach! She
tripped trying to balance herself.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Come in young ladies,” Mrs. Cole invited. They
had interrupted her tea. “Have seats.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Thank you, Mrs. Cole.” Betsy found her voice
first. “We’re too thrilled to sit down. We came to
ask permission to go to Nashville, Thanksgiving, to
the football game.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Nashville?” Mrs. Cole humped her eyebrows
as if she had never heard of the place before when
every Thanksgiving for more years than she’d care
to admit she had been besieged for permissions to
go there to the game.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Yes, ma’am. My brother Jack will drive by on
Wednesday afternoon and pick us up. We can get
to Nashville early Wednesday night and come back
Thursday night after the game.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“With proper permission from your parents, Betsy,
you, of course, may go but, Mimi, it is different with
you. This school, in the absence of your parents, is
fully responsible for you. I cannot think of giving
you permission without consulting Dr. Barnes.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi was wilting under Mrs. Cole’s droning.</p>

<p class='c010' >“You would have to take a chaperon, of course.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“But my brother is going.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“He is not Mimi’s brother.” Mrs. Cole bit off
the words. “You may see if you can find a teacher
to accompany you in case Dr. Barnes gives consent.
Now run along.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Run along they did. As fast as they could go they
went to Miss Taylor’s studio. They stopped outside
and listened. Miss Taylor was giving a lesson.
There was nothing to do but wait. They sat down in
the corridor and leaned against the wall.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Concentrate, Betsy, concentrate. Say over and
over to yourself, Miss Taylor go to Nashville, Miss
Taylor go to Nashville.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“O. K.”</p>

<p class='c010' >For five minutes neither spoke. By then Mimi was
so sure Miss Taylor would go to Nashville that she
began to think of other things.</p>

<p class='c010' >“What are you going to wear?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“That tweed suit. Your plaid wool and camel’s
hair coat would be grand.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Are you sure? I want to look nice. I’ll wash my
pigskin gloves and get a new beret. Oh, but my
nose! Does it look very bad to you, Betsy? Tell
me the truth.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“In another week we’ll never know anything was
ever the matter with it. The swelling is gone
and the bruises are fading fast. You don’t have a
hump.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“That was the good part about the fracture being
a little to the side of the bridge and the wound on
the inside. Oh, Betsy if she won’t let me go&mdash;I’ll&mdash;cable&mdash;Daddy!”</p>

<p class='c010' >“With what?” A voice asked. Sue had stepped
out of the studio and had been listening, “What’s up?”</p>

<p class='c010' >Disregarding Sue and knocking her violin case awry
they grabbed Miss Taylor one on either side.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Thanksgiving? I’m sorry but I am going to
Memphis for that whole weekend.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Blam! That quickly a bubble bursts. One pin
prick and a balloon is flat. Two dejected figures slink
down the corridor to Tumble Inn.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Why not ask your beloved Dit? Seniors can
chaperone.” It was Sue’s voice and she had been
lagging near. She couldn’t help but be interested in
other people’s business.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I couldn’t bear to have her refuse me.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I’ll go ask her by myself,” Betsy volunteered.
“I’ll take Jack’s picture and tell her she can ride in the
front seat with him and&mdash;”</p>

<p class='c010' >While Betsy was gone Mimi rummaged in the closet
for the plaid wool. Right now before another thing
happened she’d take it to the office to be sent to the
cleaners.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi had never learned that “haste makes waste.”
She grabbed up the hanger and as she swung out of
Tumble Inn, a sickening sound stopped her.</p>

<p class='c010' >B-z-z-z&mdash;</p>

<p class='c010' >She knew before she looked. She had torn the
plaid dress! One of the pockets had caught on the
door knob and besides the ripping, there was a tear.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I would,” Mimi moaned.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Remove the scowl,” Betsy called from the landing
of the stairs. “Dit can go. We’ll have to pay her
hotel bill. Do you think you can manage?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Sure. I haven’t spent anything this month so far.
I must have known something like this would happen.
But, Betsy&mdash;look what this clumsy ox has done to
the plaid wool dress!”</p>

<p class='c010' >Betsy examined it carefully.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Not so bad,” she consoled&mdash;“gimme.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Where to?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“College Hall. Janice does sewing, mending and
darning. You can get any thing done in College
Hall; typing, hair set and, best right now, sewing.
You needn’t go. I’ll drop it there on my way to the
library. See you at supper. Cheerio.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Cheerio,” Mimi echoed. She was not too cheerful
at that. There was still Dr. Barnes’ permission
or refusal with which to reckon. Unconsciously she
started to concentrate, “Dr. Barnes let me go, Dr.
Barnes let me go”&mdash;I won’t think that another silly
time. It didn’t work on Miss Taylor but I do wish to
my soul, I had Mammy Cissy’s rabbit foot.</p>

      <div class='line'>“Merrily we roll along, roll along, roll along.</div>
      <div class='line'>Merrily we roll along over the deep blue sea.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012' >“Not that way.” Mimi interrupted Betsy’s rollicking
song. “This way&mdash;Notice I did <i>not</i> say this
A-way. I’ve learned one thing at Sheridan. ‘Merrily
we <i>ride</i> along, <i>ride</i> along, <i>ride</i> along, Merrily we <i>ride</i>
along over the broad high<i>way</i>.’”</p>

<p class='c010' >“But highway doesn’t rhyme with anything,”
Betsy protested.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Who cares! Hurrah&mdash;We’re off&mdash;It could
rhyme with gay; if you insist, ’cause that’s how I feel.
This whole back seat to ourselves and we’re going
places. Whoopee! I’m afraid to open my eyes too
wide for fear I’ll find out I’m sitting in study hall
instead of zipping along this grand new road. I’ve
held my breath for days, I’ve been so scared something
would happen and we wouldn’t get off.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Waiting was the hardest thing Mimi ever did.
When she wanted anything she wanted it badly and
wanted it RIGHT THEN. The two days she
waited before Dr. Barnes finally gave her permission
to go on this wonderful spree were a month long to
Mimi. From that happy minute when Dr. Barnes,
through Mrs. Cole, had said “yes” Mimi had trod
lightly lest she burst the shimmering bubble of their
precious plans. Now it was all coming true. The
weekend bags were packed and stacked at their feet.
Dit was on the front seat with Jack evidently having
a good time. Mimi could see how she kept turning
her head toward Jack and smiling up at him and talking.
Strangely Jack was even better looking than his
picture. The photographer hadn’t caught his friendly
twinkle. When he took both Mimi’s cold little hands
and said, “So you’re the kid Betsy keeps writing about.
I need another little Sis.” Without saying so, he was
showing more than how nice he was. He was telling
Mimi that Betsy liked her; liked her enough to write
Jack about her, to invite her on this thrilling trip.
She unfolded a fringed plaid blanket and spread it
across Betsy’s knees and tucked the other end over
her own. She’d make Betsy glad she asked her instead
of an older friend.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Isn’t it all too precious?” she sighed contentedly
as she nestled down. She stared down the rolling
road which cut a straight black strip through the hills.
Without opening her lips she said to herself, “Hojoni,
Hojoni.” No need to say it aloud. Betsy was probably
feeling the same thing&mdash;beauty and happiness,
but let her say it to herself her own way. Mimi
liked to keep her magic word private unless some
one was in real trouble and needed to find the way.</p>

<p class='c010' >“How long will it take us to get there, Jack?”
Betsy had to ask twice before Jack heard or heeded.
He was finding the trail happy, too.</p>

<p class='c010' >“In time for supper, I hope. I had the dickens
of a time getting a reservation for you all. I finally
got one room. I’m staying at the House.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi knew that he referred to his fraternity house.
Betsy had told her how popular Jack had been at
school. She had two of his old annuals and a picture
of his chapter.</p>

<p class='c010' >“We can manage fine,” Dit was saying, “can’t we,
girls? Sleeping is one of the best things we do at
Sheridan&mdash;sometimes in classes. We aren’t coming
to Nashville to sleep.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi didn’t care if she never slept again. She was
so full of tingles and throbs she couldn’t sleep if she
had her own ivory bed from home. Forever afterward
when she recounted her good times at Sheridan,
one of the first things she remembered was this trip.</p>

<p class='c010' >The sun had sunk behind the hills and the bare
trees made black outlines against the graying sky before
they reached the suburbs. Traffic had increased
surprisingly in the last five miles. Once Jack swerved
so quickly to avoid a collision that the car had poised
the fraction of a second on two wheels before he
straightened it. Mimi and Betsy rolled from one
side of the back seat and back to the other. Cars,
cars, cars, two abreast, often three abreast going to
the city. The pigstands were surrounded with carefree
travelers making loud boasts about tomorrow’s
score.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Might be a good idea for us to eat supper out here,
somewhere,” Dit suggested. “I imagine every place
in town is packed and jammed. What do you think,
Jack?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Depends on how hungry we are and what you
want.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi wouldn’t dare tell how famished she was.
It wouldn’t be polite.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I had thought we’d go on in, if you all can last
another half hour, and eat at a waffle place I know.
It is off of the main ‘drag’ and while it will likely be
swamped too, they can take care of us and I believe
you all would like it.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Shall we check in at the hotel and freshen up
first?” Dit asked.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I think you look swell as you are. This is what
I’d planned. Speak now, all three of you, or forever
after hold your peace, if it doesn’t suit.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“O. K.,” the three agreed.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I thought we’d go to the waffle house and eat just
as we are. Then I’ll get you all settled in your
room. While I go out to the House to change, you
all can rest, dress, do what you please. Then we’ll
put the kids in a good movie and we’ll do the town.”
This last was to Dit.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Couldn’t be better,” was the verdict.</p>

<p class='c010' >That’s how Mimi and Betsy found themselves
jammed in the lobby of a movie waiting for the feature
to be over so they could find a seat.</p>

<p class='c010' >“If Mrs. Cole could see us now,” Betsy exclaimed,
“no brother, no chaperon, no ball-and-chain of any
description, she’d faint.” Mimi felt like a bird out
of a cage too, as they watched.</p>

<p class='c010' >The crowd came out.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Get set,” Mimi kidded shoving her head between
Betsy’s shoulders. “Give me some interference and
I’ll lug the ball through.” Mimi knew a lot about
football. She had watched the kids at home play on
the corner lot; had even played a time or two herself
when there weren’t enough without her. Honky
had told her a lot about it, too. He played on B. G.
Hi.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Signals,” Betsy answered.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Seven-Eleven-Hike,” Mimi answered shoving
hard.</p>

<p class='c010' >By pushing and scrouging and holding to each
other, they managed to plow down the aisle to two
seats. The newsreel was on flashing pictures of a
suspected kidnapper across the screen.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I’d like to spit on him,” Mimi hissed to Betsy
as she popped the folding seat down. All the hatred
she felt for Fritzie with the tattoed arms, Freida, and
the short man, who had cast a blight on Chloe’s life,
was in that sentence.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I’d like to scratch him and kick him,” Betsy hissed
back. She was thinking of Chloe too.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Wonder what Sue and Chloe are doing?” Mimi
said.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Study hall,” replied Betsy scornfully.</p>

<p class='c010' >Then realizing how rude it was to even whisper at
a talkie they gradually became interested in the
comedy. It was Popeye and he made Mimi shriek
with delight but the tattoed anchors on his brawny
forearms were an ugly reminder. They pricked the
back of her mind and she was not quite happy. Before
the feature was well begun and, as she was beginning
to lose herself in it, a sudden commotion riveted
her attention to the back of the theatre. There was
a regular stampede. Mimi and Betsy turned to each
other inquiringly. Each hated to admit she did not
know what was going on. They were not in the
dark long. Soon every one in the theatre knew what
was up and, at least in spirit, joined in the celebration.
The supporters and pep squad of the visiting
team had crashed the show. They overran the lobby,
the aisles, and the cheer leaders vaulted the orchestra
pit to the stage. After five minutes of yelling and
bedlam in general they left as suddenly as they had
come. The heroine’s voice sounded small indeed in
the void they left behind them.</p>

<p class='c010' >What next, Mimi wondered, but nothing else happened
until the girls were out of the show. They
were only a block and a half from the hotel and Jack
had given them explicit directions. He had even
spoken to the clerk at the desk. In case they made the
wrong turn en route they had only to look up and
around to see the big neon sign of the hotel flashing
welcome.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Let’s window shop,” Betsy suggested before they
covered the half block.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Suits,” Mimi replied.</p>

<p class='c010' >Up and down Church Street, up and down Fifth
Avenue, hand in hand, the girls strolled exclaiming
in front of this window and that. The jolly crowd
jostled them but the girls elbowed along and laughed
back.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I always imagined New Orleans was like this at
Mardi Gras time,” Betsy commented. “Wouldn’t
you love to go?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“If it were any more fun than this, I couldn’t live,”
Mimi replied.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Let’s get a sundae before we go up.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“You think of the grandest things,” Mimi answered
following Betsy into the crowded drug store.
There were no vacant tables so the girls sat on high
stools at the fountain and dangled their legs. Two
butterscotch sundaes appeared and disappeared.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Let’s make a night of it while we have a chance,”
Mimi said twirling around on the stool and walking
over to pay the check.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Anything you can think of?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Candy! Doesn’t this look grand? I’ll get a
dime’s worth of bonbons and you get a dime’s worth
of caramels, that is unless you prefer some other kinds.
Let’s end the evening with candy.”</p>

<p class='c010' >It is a wonder they were not ill the next day but
they weren’t. They felt fine. Mimi could hardly
contain herself. They were so sound asleep when Dit
had come in that she rolled them over to make room
for herself without waking either. They slept
soundly as tired babies. That is why they were so
fresh this morn.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Wonder what time Dit came in?” Mimi whispered
to Betsy in the bathroom. They had managed
to get up without awakening her.</p>

<p class='c010' >“None of our business,” Betsy replied. “Let’s dress
right quickly and go down to the coffee shop and
eat breakfast and have Dit’s sent up for a surprise.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Suits.” Mimi had picked up this word at Sheridan
and she found it an apt answer to many questions.</p>

<p class='c010' >The two felt very important walking on the thick
carpet to the elevator.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I don’t know if it’s being away from Daddy and
Mother Dear or being fourteen or what, but I am
beginning to feel so grown up. After this hotel experience
I feel I could go on most any trip and take
care of myself.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“You should never have any trouble, not you, with
all the questions you can ask.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“All right, Smartie, I’ll ask you one. What do we
eat and what shall we order for Dit?”</p>

<p class='c010' >Whatever they ordered they ate quickly so that
they could get back to the room to waken Dit before
her tray was sent. In spite of their hurry, someone
else had wakened Dit. When the girls walked in,
she was standing in the middle of the room in her
negligee hugging a cardboard florist’s box almost as
tall as she.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Mums!” she cried, “Mums&mdash;It couldn’t be anything
else.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Dit was right. When she had snapped the green
tape, raised the lid and torn back the damp oiled paper
there were six gorgeous big yellow chrysanthemums.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi and Betsy looked on with envy. Oh to be
grown up and have beaux who sent flowers! Mimi
was sure at that moment she could never love a man
who forgot to send flowers.</p>

<p class='c010' >Dit’s fingers trembled as she took out the card.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>For my three girl friends</div>
      <div class='line'>To wear to a Vandy Victory.</div>
    <div class='c003'>Jack.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010' >Mimi’s merry blue eyes shone. Betsy’s cute eyes
glowed with pride. After all he was <i>her</i> brother.</p>

<p class='c010' >There was nothing in the room large enough to contain
the flowers. They made the vases top heavy.
After toppling the second one over, Mimi tried the
metal waste paper basket and it leaked. As a last
resort they thought of the bath tub. While they
were filling it, Dit’s breakfast came.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Another surprise,” she cried. “What nice hostesses
you girls are.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Indeed it was a day of surprises and one of them
was not so nice.</p>

<p class='c010' >Jack called for them in a taxi to go to the game.</p>

<p class='c010' >“This way we can go right to the entrance of our
section. Otherwise, we’d have to park, no telling
where or I’d have to drive you all up and go park
the car and take a chance on finding you again. I
don’t want to lose you,” he added to all three but he
meant Dit.</p>

<p class='c010' >The taxi reminded Mimi of her gloomy arrival at
Sheridan. However, this was fun. There was only
room for three on the back seat of the cab so Mimi sat
on a little seat that folded down from the side. Jack
insisted on using it himself but Mimi really liked it.
She clung to the strap as they bounced along, sure
that nothing in the world could be more fun. She
felt so dressed up with her new beret which she wore
down over one eye as Millie had worn her sailor hat
at camp. Mimi knew everyone they passed admired
the big yellow <i>mum</i> she had pinned so carefully to
her lapel. She had to be careful when she turned her
head that way. The cold yellow petals caressed her
chin.</p>

<p class='c010' >When they piled out of the taxi Jack bought them
something else&mdash;cute little footballs dangling on black
and yellow satin ribbons!</p>

<p class='c010' >“Wait ’til Sue and Chloe see these!” she said to
Betsy as they followed the usher down to their seats.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Be sure and save your program, too,” she said
to Betsy. “Watch me and if you see me chewing
mine or tearing the corners off, slap my hands.”</p>

<p class='c010' >But Mimi forgot even her own program when the
team came out. The running, kicking, passing fascinated
her. It wasn’t the first time Mimi had wished
she were a boy. Still if you were a boy you’d have
to <i>send</i> flowers, not <i>wear</i> them.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Wish they’d hurry and start,” Jack said. “It’s
our game if the rain holds off. The dope says Vandy
will win by two touchdowns. But rain would make
it anybody’s game.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Let me be a kill-joy for just once,” Betsy said to
Mimi. “Look.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi’s eyes followed Betsy’s finger.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Do you see what I see?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Ugh!&mdash;Uniforms&mdash;almost like ours.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Betsy was pointing to the rows and rows of Ward-Belmont
girls.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I can almost see Mrs. Cole! Betsy, you old
meanie!”</p>

<p class='c010' >The rain held off until the show between halves
was over. Mimi would be thankful for that always.
This was her first big game and the show of the Pep
Squad and the band was a brand new thrill. Marching
feet, martial music, perfectly timed yells. Mimi
could not keep her eyes from the cheer leaders. She
watched their every move. When she got back to
Sheridan she would try some of those antics herself.
Forming of the great V and the singing of “Alma
Mater” took Mimi’s breath. She stood reverently
and throbbed to every note.</p>

<p class='c010' >Before the last words were finished the rain which
had been threatening since noon began. It came in
torrents. This was the only unpleasant thing of
the whole trip.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Shall we leave?” Jack asked.</p>

<p class='c010' >“No, no, a thousand times no,” came three
answers.</p>

<p class='c010' >Jack turned his coat wrong side out and turned
his hat down. The girls buttoned up their coats.
Mimi wished for her old felt hat so she could turn
it down. A trickle from the beret was tickling her
nose. She squinted her eyes. She was glad she didn’t
use make-up or her face would look streaked and ugly
as some of the ladies who had looked so lovely in
the sunshine.</p>

<p class='c010' >The game became a scramble. Mimi hated to see
the jerseys of the players get muddy. Soon you could
not tell one team from the other. Time and time
again the referee called time out to dry the ball. It
was a mess. Mimi didn’t know the final score for sure
until she asked Jack. She knew Vandy won and for
that she was glad.</p>

<p class='c010' >“We won’t be able to make any time driving back
to Sheridan,” Jack said when they were safe from the
shower in a taxi.</p>

<p class='c010' >“That means we’d better start as soon as we can
throw our things together,” Dit said.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Couldn’t stay over?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“No, I promised Mrs. Cole we’d be back tonight
and also that I would not ask for extended permission.
That’s the usual thing and Dr. Barnes doesn’t
like it.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Who minds a little thing like rain?” Mimi asked.
“Betsy and I don’t. We’ll be ‘singing in the rain’ all
the way home.”</p>

<p class='c010' >And they did.</p>

<p class='c010' >They sang until they were so hoarse they could
hardly whisper by the time they arrived at Sheridan.
Jack was afraid they had taken cold.</p>

<p class='c010' >“We aren’t hoarse, Mrs. Cole,” Betsy said later.
“It’s so late we are whispering and trying not to disturb.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mrs. Cole hustled them off giving them time for
only the briefest thanks and goodbyes to Jack.</p>

<p class='c010' >When they turned on the light in Tumble Inn to
waken Chloe and Sue, they found only two empty
beds.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Well now that <i>is</i> something!” Mimi declared.
She was still clutching her weekend bag in one hand
and a wilted flower, a wet program and a faded little
football in the other.</p>

<p class='c010' >“You’ll have to sleep with me,” Betsy said.</p>

<p class='c010' >That made everything all right except Mimi felt
she would pop if she had to wait until morning to tell
about the marvelous time she had had. Telling it
was going to be almost as much fun as having it had
been.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXII' class='c008'>CHAPTER XII<br /> <br />TEA FOR TWO</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009' >Mimi was in front of the mirror in her green polka
dot pajamas trying to do a back flip like a Vandy
cheer leader when Sue and Chloe walked in. Betsy
was still in bed.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Pardon me,” Sue grinned. “I was looking for
Tumble Inn and gracious me, my eyes must be going
back on me. I’ve walked right into Barnum and
Bailey’s circus winter quarters.”</p>

<p class='c010' >She winked at Chloe who could always manage to
keep a straight face and they backed out.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Here,” Mimi called so loud that she awakened
Betsy. “Don’t dare leave without coming in and telling
us where you’ve been.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Oh&mdash;places.” Chloe teased shrugging&mdash;“and
you?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“You know good and well where we’ve been but
oh boy! We had a perfectly precious time. Look,”
Mimi gushed pointing out her souvenirs. She had
pinned the football up by the mirror near Jack’s
picture. The program was being pressed dry under
the treasure chest.</p>

<p class='c010' >Before Sue had time to examine either or Chloe
to admire the crushed mums in the window, Mimi
was exclaiming, “Out with it. Where have you
been?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I don’t care,” Betsy said sleepily. “Don’t tell
us.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Aunt Marcia came to see me,” Chloe said proudly.
It was fine to have a family.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Where is she?” Mimi wanted to know. She’d
like to see Aunt Marcia. She wished she had the
nerve to ask her some questions. Was she a large,
slow moving woman? If you called her Aunt Freida
suddenly as if by mistake would she flinch?</p>

<p class='c010' >“Gone. We went out to dinner and a movie with
her and spent the night at the hotel with her. She
left on the early train and sent us home in a taxi.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“That makes us even,” Betsy said. “What are
we going to do all day. This is only Friday and
there’s tomorrow, too.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“So few of us are here, I imagine we can do what
we please. I know,” Mimi raised her voice, “let’s
ride horseback!”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Oh, let’s.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“We can rent horses out at the Riding Academy.
The college girls go all the time and I’ve just been
dying to. Betsy, would you ask Mrs. Cole?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I will if no one else will but I asked her just the
other day about Nashville. How about you, Sue?
Did you or Chloe ask for your permission?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Aunt Marcia asked for us,” Chloe answered for
Sue.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Sure, I’ll ask,” Sue spoke up.</p>

<p class='c010' >While Sue was gone the usual wail went up.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I intended to wash my hose, write letters, review
my geometry, get up my book report&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class='c010' >All three had a list.</p>

<p class='c010' >“There’s always tomorrow,” Mimi quoted
solemnly. “It’s a perfect day to ride&mdash;crisp and
clear.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“We can go if we take Miss Bassett,” Sue burst in
with the news.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Grand,” Betsy cried, “but you know what that
means. We will have to pay for her horse. Gee!
I’m nearly broke.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Don’t spoil your pretty face with frowns and
wrinkles, lovely,” Chloe said quickly. “Aunt Marcia
gave me $5.00, <i>five dollars</i>, can you hear?”</p>

<p class='c010' >She ran to her purse and reassured herself it was
there.</p>

<p class='c010' >“We’ll pay you back, Chloe.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Don’t worry. It’s all in the family.”</p>

<p class='c010' >The girls were beginning to feel like a family,
really. Their schedules had smoothed out, they were
accustomed to each other’s individuality, the ugly
head of rivalry and jealousy which leered the first
few days had withdrawn. They enjoyed each other
and shared their food, spending money, and now for
the first time they were wearing each other’s clothes.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi, of course, had a beautifully tailored habit.
She had taken good care of her patent leather boots.
The other girls had jodphurs, so by exchanging
blouses and sweaters a few times they managed to fit
themselves out becomingly. Chloe had the worst
time of all. Everything she had on but her jodphurs
was borrowed. She had never been on a horse
in her life. She wasn’t too keen on the idea but tried
not to show how she felt, Mimi guessed.</p>

<p class='c010' >“We’ll take good care of you, Chloe. I can give
you a few pointers that will help you. So can Miss
Bassett. We’ll all ride slowly and keep together.
We’ll have a grand time.”</p>

<p class='c010' >They did have a grand time; although, Chloe and
Sue both limped the next two or three days when no
one was looking.</p>

<p class='c010' >When they returned they stopped in the Post Office.
That was one place Mimi never passed without peeking
in. Although, she knew exactly when the mail was
put up she always had a hopeful feeling. Today she
was not disappointed. There was a big fat letter from
Mother Dear. Mimi dropped her hat and crop and
ripped the letter open.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Wait ’till Olivia sees this stamp,” she said. “She’ll
go wild.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi devoured every word of the letter. She
trailed the other girls on up to Tumble Inn for the
second reading which was usually aloud. Sue, particularly
enjoyed news of Mimi’s family.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi straddled a chair backwards, unfolded the
letter and prepared to read&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class='c010' >“Where is Sue? This is getting queer. Has she
an invisible cloak? Every time I’ve looked for her
lately she has disappeared.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“She had a notice in her box to come to the studio.
Miss Taylor wanted to see her.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“What are you saying about me, Chloe?” Sue
asked poking her head around the door.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Eavesdroppers hear no good of themselves,”
Betsy quoted.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Come down to the studio with me, Mimi&mdash;’sprise.”</p>

<p class='c010' >She need say no more&mdash;at the word “s’prise,” Mimi
was up and after her.</p>

<p class='c010' >“You can usher with me at Albert Spaulding’s recital!”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi failed to catch Sue’s enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Crazy&mdash;you will get to wear your long wedding
dress and high heeled slippers&mdash;now&mdash;say something.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Swell! I begin to catch on. But how did you
manage to get me in? I’m not a music student.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Simple enough. The college music students are
going to receive and serve at the reception and the
preps are to usher at the recital. There are so few
of us this year that Miss Taylor thought we’d better
get one or two outsiders. The minute I caught on I
asked her if I could ask you. Here we are and Miss
Taylor can tell us exactly what she wants us to do.”</p>

<p class='c010' >The recital was the biggest event between Thanksgiving
and Christmas. For Sue it was one of the high
points of the year. Mimi tried to be as interested
as Sue expected her to be.</p>

<p class='c010' >Dressing up in the long dress was fun. Thank
goodness, Miss Jane had chosen a rainbow wedding.
Her dress was orchid and Sue’s was blue. Only one
or two girls mentioned that they were made alike.
Every time Mimi wore the high heeled pumps she
handled herself better. Eventually she hoped to walk
gracefully in them, to float along as Miss Jane had.
Mimi even went so far as to pay a college girl fifteen
cents to set her hair. Even though she was wearing
it longer than she had at camp, the wave wouldn’t
make it “stay put.” It wasn’t that kind of hair.
Betsy and Chloe had fussed over them no end, patting
and preening.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Leave your hair alone, Mimi,” Chloe despaired.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi tried to. All the time she was greeting people
and marching sedately up and down the aisle, she
carried her head a bit to one side so the wildest lock
of hair would not fall in her eyes. However, she
and Sue had not been through their duties and seated
ten minutes before Mimi unconsciously tucked the
lock behind her ear. Sue did not notice. She was
entranced with the music.</p>

<p class='c010' >To her there were only two people there, herself
and Albert Spaulding in that enchanted realm of music.
His nimble fingers, supple wrist, the powerful
singing tones brought tears to her eyes. She followed
with understanding. She was aware of nothing but
a violin laughing, crying.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi was moved by the music but she was much
more aware of the artist himself. She was pleased
that he was tall, that his shoulders were broad. She
loved the way he stood with his feet wide apart.
How grand to see an artist who was, withal, such a
man. Mimi’s mind kept hopping to tennis racquets
and other sporting goods which had made his family
famous. Then she would come back to the music.
Several times she checked down the program to see
how much longer it was.</p>

<p class='c010' >She knew exactly how to act at the reception which
followed. Only the music students were presented
to the artist and Mimi felt she shouldn’t barge in on
that. She had been very lucky to get to usher. She
did, however, go down the receiving line and chatter
with many of the college girls. She liked knowing
them. She was fast growing into one herself. Nor
did she pass up the punch and wafers. Not Mimi.
Sue found her there.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Lead me upstairs, please,” Sue plead in such a
queer voice that for a moment, Mimi was frightened.
Was Sue ill? Had she stood on her high heels too
long? Was she going to faint? She was holding
out her hand to Mimi.</p>

<p class='c010' >“What on earth? Why, you’re trembling!”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Oh, Mimi!” Sue gasped, “I shook his wonderful,
magic-making hand!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIII' class='c008'>CHAPTER XIII<br /> <br />DECK THE HALLS WITH BOUGHS OF HOLLY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009' >“What’s the matter with Mimi?” Madge asked Sue.
“Everytime any one mentions Christmas she flounces
out of the room.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I hadn’t noticed but I can guess. It’s the first
Christmas she was ever away from her folks and
that must be it. She has the grandest family. I’ll
miss them, too. The Hammond’s always have open
house all through the holidays and our crowd almost
lives over there.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I’m glad I asked you. I was beginning to think
it was I. I am queer but I can’t help it. I couldn’t
bear it if Mimi stopped liking me.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Don’t be silly. Mimi likes everybody. She
doesn’t think you are queer. I don’t either. I’ve heard
her say you were a very interesting girl. So there.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Have you really, Sue? Cross your heart?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Yeh.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Thanks. Thanks too much. I like Mimi better
than any girl in school. I always have and since
she turned down those bids to join the clubs, I’ve
adored her. Gee! That took nerve. But you won’t
tell her, will you, Sue?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“No, I cross my heart again.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Thanks.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Sue forgot Madge’s sensitiveness right away. She
had other things to consider in regard to Mimi. Why
hadn’t she thought sooner that Mimi had nowhere
to go Christmas? Gee! It would be terrible if she
had to stay here with everyone else home. Sue would
write home for permission to invite Mimi to her
house. No. That would take too long. Mimi was
already dreading Christmas. Sue knew that every
other year Mimi had considered Christmas the wish-come-true
time of times. She’d ask her now and then
write home. Sometimes she had to do things backwards.
Her daddy called it taking the bull by the horns.</p>

<p class='c010' >“A&mdash;D&mdash;F A&mdash;B&mdash;F!” Sue thrilled as she
walked faster and faster toward the gym. She was
trying so hard to memorize Souvenir for the Christmas
recital but she couldn’t practice until she settled
Mimi’s Christmas arrangements.</p>

<p class='c010' >“E-e-e-prettee!” She shrieked the old camp call
from the balcony of the gym.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi let the ball fly sidewise as she looked up.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Hey! Aw Sue, you made me miss.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Sorry. Getting good?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Am I? Seven fouls out of ten. Not bad?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Regular dead eye!”</p>

<p class='c010' >“What brings you here fiddle in hand? Are you
going to play a balcony scene?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“No. I came to invite you to spend Christmas
with me.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Bowling Green&mdash;Cissy, King, Von, Miss Jane and
Dick, Dottie, Margie, Jean, Honky&mdash;heaven! As
near perfect a Christmas as could be without precious,
precious Mother Dear and Junior so far, so very far
away. The distance had been widening daily ever
since Mimi had mailed their presents to Germany.
She had wrapped her packages quietly and mailed
them without telling, but she had known they were
gone, known how lonely Christmas would be and Sue
had guessed. Dear roly-poly Sue who was never
lonesome herself.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi blinked and gasped.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Sue, do you really?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“No savvy Englesh?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Why, Sue! I’d love to, only, do you think it
will be all right with your Mother?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“You don’t think I’d ask you if it wasn’t, do you?
Why&mdash;” Sue had to be convincing now. “Mother
is writing Mrs. Cole&mdash;and Dr. Barnes both so that
there can be no question about your permission!”
Sue stopped triumphantly. When Mrs. Cole’s and
Dr. Barnes’ names were mentioned, all was said that
could be said.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Providing the permission comes through, I accept.
Yes, a thousand times yes.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Good! See you at supper.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi watched Sue disappear. Sweet Sue. She
put the basket ball back in the locker, without putting
her sweater on, she jogged across the short cut
from the back door of the gym to Prep Hall ell.</p>

<p class='c010' >So much to do! She hadn’t been studying as much
as she should of late. The lessons and notebooks
had been piling up to be worked on during Christmas
while her suite mates were gone. Now that she
was going to celebrate too, she would have to make
things fly. As soon as she changed clothes, she’d go
to the library and get <i>Greene’s Source Book</i> and catch
up on her outside reading in history. At study hall
tonight she’d make every minute count. She would
not look at the clock a single time, or get permission
to speak to a soul, or to sharpen her pencil or to
fill her pen unless it was an emergency. After study
hall she would mend her hose, straighten her trunk,
the dresser’s drawers and if there was time before
light bell, she’d check up on her allowance and see
if she could squeeze out a new pair of gloves. While
she was home she could get several things. Daddy
had oked a charge account for her and had told her
she could order things but so far she hadn’t used it.
She was trying to spend as little as possible because
Daddy’s expenses must be terrific. She knew he had
not planned on spending so much on her until she
was college age.</p>

<p class='c010' >Plans were racing through her head.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I’m going to Bowling Green, I’m going to Bowling
Green.” Her mind played an accompaniment to
her marching feet. Thinking was so thrilling, before
she realized it, those marching feet were detouring
by Sue’s practice room instead of keeping the straight
trail to the library. She’d only stay a minute. She’d
have to rave a while and calm down or she could
never sit still in the library with the source book.</p>

<p class='c010' >Opening the big door to the practice rooms was
like opening the door of a menagerie at feeding time.
Standing in the hall from which the cell like rooms
opened, Mimi’s ears were assailed by squeaks, grunts,
and ferociously thundering bass notes. Mimi bumped
into the proctor who was looking through the glass
windows in the doors to check and be sure that the
music students were keeping their regular practice
times and&mdash;that no one was playing jazz. She scowled
at Mimi.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Could I speak to Sue a second?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“If you’ll hurry and leave before I do. I am not
supposed to leave any one here without special permission.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi ducked in Sue’s cell. The watchful eye of the
proctor cramped Mimi’s style but she got in a few
hurried expostulations. Who could say much with
the feeling that some one was holding a stop watch
over them?</p>

<p class='c010' >“Put your sweater on,” motherly little Sue called
after her.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Thanks a lot,” Mimi said as she brushed past the
proctor on the way out. Some hopeful soprano was
singing, “Who Is Sylvia?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Not Sylvia. Who is Chloe?” As if she didn’t
have enough on her mind without being haunted by
that.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi had no sooner stored away the mystery about
Chloe, the happy holidays ahead, and determinedly
buried herself in the source book when some one
stepped up behind her and covered her eyes with two
cold hands. She started to cry out, then remembered
where she was. Placards with “SILENCE” were in
plain sight all around in case one was prone to forget.
Silently she removed the fingers and twisted
around. It was Chloe; her glowing dark eyes lighted
up her whole beautiful face. Mimi had never seen
her so radiant.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Meet me outside&mdash;quick,” she whispered.</p>

<p class='c010' >Goodbye history reading. Mimi’s insatiable
curiosity had the best of her. She followed Chloe
out as quickly as she could return the book to the
desk.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Guess what?” Chloe exclaimed when they were
safely out of the quiet zone.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi could only think of one thing. Chloe had a
clue to her identity.</p>

<p class='c010' >“You have found out&mdash;?” She didn’t know how
to say what she was hoping.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Not that,” Chloe replied quickly sobering up.
“But maybe while we’re there we can find out&mdash;”</p>

<p class='c010' >“While we’re where?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“At Aunt Marcia’s! I just received a letter and
she says I may bring someone home for the holidays
and, of course, I want you, Mimi. I’m asking you
first.”</p>

<p class='c010' >What could Mimi do? As much as she would love
to go to Sue’s she would miss all that fun for the
chance to ferret out more about Chloe. She wanted
to meet Aunt Marcia. She and Chloe would have
a good time, too.</p>

<p class='c010' >“That’s mighty nice of you, Chloe.”</p>

<p class='c010' >As Mimi fumbled for words she could see Chloe’s
feathers fall.</p>

<p class='c010' >“It isn’t that I don’t want to. Please don’t think
that&mdash;but I’ve accepted Sue’s invitation, but maybe&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Oh, it’s quite all right.” Chloe’s chin went up.
“I understand perfectly.”</p>

<p class='c010' >As they walked too silently toward Tumble Inn,
Mimi was sure she didn’t. However what happened
next did help. Betsy was rushing to meet
them.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Mimi, I’ve looked high and low for you. Where
have you been?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“The library.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“No!”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Yes, I have. Study has caught up with me. Before
holidays begin I am going to know more than&mdash;”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Holidays? That’s what I want to see you about.
Mother says I may bring you home for the holidays.
Of course, you’ll come?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Home-for-the-holidays.” Mimi repeated slowly.
“What is this a frame up or a song?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“A what?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“It is funny,” Chloe was smiling now. “You see,
Betsy, Sue asked her, you ask her, I ask her! Whew!
Is she popular?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Please&mdash;” Mimi was embarrassed. “You are all
honeys to want me. I still think you’re kidding!”</p>

<p class='c010' >“We are not,” said Sue having arrived in time to
hear the last of the discussion. “We want you.
But remember, you’ve promised <i>me</i>.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“What we should have,” Mimi said suddenly inspired,
“is a house party! Then we could all be together.
A progressive house party. Oh, if Mother
Dear were only home!”</p>

<p class='c010' >For several days the girls buzzed with ideas about
a house party but as Mimi disgustedly phrased it they,
“got no where fast.” However, Sue’s mother, as
Mothers often do these days, had followed Sue’s instructions
to the letter.</p>

<p class='c010' >After calling Mimi on the carpet, not the magic
carpet by any chance, and impressing upon her what
a trying position the school would be in if anything
should happen to her, Mimi received permission.</p>

<p class='c010' >Now on the day before departure she was stacking
out her things to pack.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Sue, I can hardly contain myself.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi went into a rhapsody ending in a clog. She
poised breathless, hands on hips, head to one side,
face flushed.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I’m as thrilled as I was when we packed for camp.
Far as I am concerned they might as well not meet
classes today. All I want to do is ‘Deck the halls with
boughs of holly, fa, la, la, la, la; la, la, la, la’.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Why are you holding your head, Mimi?” Chloe
asked tumbling in from the hall over Sue’s bag.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I’m kind of dizzy,” Mimi replied sitting down
on the side of the bed. “I’ll be all right in a minute.”</p>

<p class='c010' >She wasn’t. When she came up to her room after
lunch she was aching and shivering. Soda! That
was what she needed, soda water&mdash;That would cure
anything.</p>

<p class='c010' >Ca-chew! Yes, if this was a cold soda was the very
thing. She’d go right down to the kitchen now and
get some. If she went to the infirmary&mdash;Well, no use
taking a chance. But she was all right. She had to
be&mdash;Ca-chew! She remembered her last trip for
soda and felt her face burning. Betsy and Madge and
the alarm. Betsy still did not know why Madge
failed. That was the only secret she had from Betsy
now. Ca-chew!</p>

<p class='c010' >She sneezed once too often. Mrs. Cole passing and
hearing poked her head in.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Who is that sneezing? Here let me feel your
head. Child, you have fever. Come with me.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Too amazed to resist, and aching and feeling much
worse than she cared to admit, Mimi allowed Mrs.
Cole to lead her to the Infirmary Wing. Nurse took
one good look.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Flu,” she said. “If we don’t have some freezing
weather soon, there will be an epidemic. Quarantine,
for you, young lady.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I can’t come up here. I’m leaving tomorrow.”
Mimi protested. “I’m all right, really I am, Nurse.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Fever one hundred and one-half; eyes red, nose
dripping.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Sue’s mother will fix&mdash;Ca-chew!&mdash;me up&mdash;”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Mrs. Cole have her roommate bring up her robe
and pajamas and toilette articles. Mimi is staying
with me.”</p>

<p class='c010' >As Nurse tucked her in and put an ice bag on her
hot head, Mimi raised to her elbows.</p>

<p class='c010' >“What now?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“The singing,” Mimi said smiling sadly. “Hear.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Into the open window floated the strains of “Noel,
Noel.” The Glee Club was practicing but the glad
tidings sounded very faint and far away to Mimi.
For once in her life Christmas would come too soon.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIV' class='c008'>CHAPTER XIV<br /> <br />THE LAND OF COUNTERPANE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009' >Mimi ran her fingers up and down the crinkles of the
blue and white striped bed cover. She made dents
with her fists for lakes then smoothed them all out
and began again. This time she made a deep curving
gulley which was Green River flowing around Camp.
The flat space over her stomach was the open space
around the flag pole where the campers had gathered
as soon after reveille as they could slide into their
bathing suits. The small point she had pinched up
with her fingers was the Lodge and the great bump
her doubled up knees made was the Hotel far up on
the hill above camp.</p>

<p class='c010' >Chimes rang out in the distance, suddenly her
knees collapsed and she burrowed her flushed face in
the pillow. A miniature earthquake had leveled her
make-believe land. Now it was raining on her pillow.
What a great god she was to build country
and shake it down and wash away the debris with
rain.</p>

<p class='c010' >After the deluge she was as alone as in the beginning.
All of her best friends were gone. They had
not been permitted in the ward to say goodbye. When
Nurse relayed their farewells from the corridor to the
patient some of the sadness melted away, but not all,
not by any means.</p>

<p class='c010' >She had begun all the make-believe nonsense to
keep from remembering it was Christmas and that
she was sick-a-bed without her family, without her
chums. But it was no use. Stubbornly she put her
mind back to her “Child’s Garden of Verse.” She
said “The Friendly Cow,” “Singing in the Rain,”
“Sea Cups,” and in spite of herself between each one
she would revert to “When I was sick and lay
abed&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class='c010' >The siege of flu had begun to look like an epidemic.
There were six single beds in a row in the Infirmary
and this Christmas morning each bed cradled a sick
girl. Mimi, however, was the only one awake.</p>

<p class='c010' >Ding, dong&mdash;ding, dong.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi listened to the bells ring out. Perhaps they
could do what trying-very-hard and poetry had failed
to do. But she gave up. There was no use trying
to forget it was Christmas for all day there would be
reminders. She must hope that somewhere in Leipzig
Junior was dumping the contents of a bulging
stocking on his bed instead of racing with her and
winning by sliding down the bannisters to their usual
tree at home. She hoped the gifts she had sent arrived
in time. If it took as long for things to go to
Leipzig as it did for them to come from there to America,
the gifts would be late. Mimi knew that Mother
Dear had sent her something in plenty of time but
so far no package had reached her. As soon as Nurse
would let her get up she would go to the Post Office
and ask them to send a tracer. She was that sure
Mother and Daddy had not failed her.</p>

<p class='c010' >Gray morning was peeping around the cracks of
the window shades. Mimi leaned over and eased
her shade up the tiniest bit; at least that is what she
intended to do but the shade slipped from her cold
fingers and went whr-r-r&mdash;zip&mdash;all the way to the
top. Mimi shut her eyes against the sound, and when
she opened them and looked out, wonder of wonders
a fairy world bade her good-morning. So softly
the snow had fallen that no sleeper had heard.</p>

<p class='c010' >Nose against the pane, breath making fantastic
wreaths on the glass, hands clutched as if praying,
Mimi gasped in awe. Then because she could never
be unhappy long and because it was Christmas inside
her, a WHITE Christmas, she sang out:</p>

<p class='c010' >“Merry CHRISTMAS! Oh wake up, wake up,
there is snow!”</p>

<p class='c010' >Weak hands rubbing swollen eyes. Tousled heads
rearing from pillows. Necks craned toward nearest
windows.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Merry Christmas yourself.” “Snow.” “Oh,
SNOW!”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Merry Christmas!” Nurse’s clear, crisp voice rose
above the others. “What chance does an amateur
Santa Claus have with all you girls already wide
awake? I was outside in the hall hanging the last
bangles on your tree when ‘there arose such a clatter,
I sprang to the DOOR to see what was the matter’!”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Our tree?” came the chorus.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Yes, your tree. You don’t think I’m mean enough
to make you stay in bed and feast on orange juice
instead of plum pudding without doing something
for you?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“May I come in?” It was Mrs. Cole in a fresh
blouse and newly pressed skirt. She looked sweeter
than Mimi had ever seen her. “Merry Christmas,
girls. If you’ll help me, Nurse, we’ll roll the tree
in.”</p>

<p class='c010' >It was not a large tree; a living evergreen growing
in a wooden tub and riding into the sick room on a
rolling white hospital cart-table. Mimi had passed
it by the steps many times scarcely noticing but today,
decked so gayly and glittering so magnificently, it
was as new as the snow. As they pushed the tree along
the ornaments made an elfin jingle.</p>

<p class='c010' >Yesterday Mimi had wished her bed were at one
end of the ward or the other so that she could lie on
one side with her back to illness and forget it. Now
she was glad that she was in the center of the room
because the tree, placed in the middle of the room,
was at the foot of her bed. If nurse had not made up
the bed with tight square corners she could wriggle
her toes free and touch it.</p>

<p class='c010' >“There!”</p>

<p class='c010' >Nurse and Mrs. Cole stood one to either side admiring
their handiwork.</p>

<p class='c010' >“But no presents or mail until baths, temperatures
taken all around, and breakfast.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi knew Nurse meant exactly what she said and
that no amount of begging would change her orders.
Now if it were Mrs. Cole in charge.... But she
wasn’t. Nurse’s word was law and obeyed to the
letter. So was Dr. Ansley’s. Mimi tried not to show
how impatient she was but eagerness danced in her
merry blue eyes.</p>

<p class='c010' >The hour finally came and for once, Mimi had
more surprises than she could stand. The last one
was the biggest and it brought tears.</p>

<p class='c010' >First the mail was distributed. Nurse did not
call out the names. She had it all sorted and handed
each girl a neat stack. Otherwise, she would have
read “Mimi Hammond” every other name for Mimi
had as much mail as all the others put together.</p>

<p class='c010' >Now for the packages.</p>

<p class='c010' >The first one handed to Mimi made her heart leap.
From Leipzig.&mdash;Careful not the tear the stamps, she
ripped it open and lifted out three separate packages.
She opened the lumpy one from Junior first. Not
a guess what it was. It didn’t rattle or move about.
What could it be? A peasant doll! Braided hair,
crisp white cap, full skirts held in place by a tight
bodice. Precious! The doll would sit on top of
Mimi’s trunk in the living room so that all who
opened the door of two hundred and seven could see
and admire. And what could this one from Daddy
be? Shake it. Feel it. No; guess again. Wrong
both times. A Bohemian necklace with a crystal
pendant to wear to Christmas parties. Daddy liked
every one well and gay. He must realize, too, that
she was growing up. This thin, flat package from
Mother. Not as thick as a book but about that shape.
Careful! Don’t tear. A picture and what a sweet
one! Mimi did not fully appreciate what she had
until the letter came telling about the trip to the
Dresden Gallery to see Coregio’s, “The Holy Night,”
and the “Sistine Madonna.” The print they sent
Mimi was a Hanfstaengel called “The Cherubim,”
artistically copying the little angels who hover around
the Virgin in the full picture of the Madonna. Beaming
faces. Mimi loved them. What wonderful gifts
from Leipzig!</p>

<p class='c010' >Then the small packages. Stationery from Chloe
with Tumble Inn hand blocked in the upper left
corner. Oh, these art students. Mimi’s fingers felt
thick and clumsy as she untied Betsy’s package. It
did not look neat but Mimi never judged inside by
outside. An enviable black and white sport belt to
wear with her riding habit. Two plain sport handkerchiefs
from Madge with this verse printed on the
card:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Some hankies for show,</div>
      <div class='line'>Some hankies for blow;</div>
      <div class='line'>You know which to do</div>
      <div class='line'>When you have flu.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010' >She hadn’t realized how clever Madge was. Olivia
had left sealing wax and a Sheridan signet. Dit’s
card was almost as good as a present. Under the
greeting she had written, “To my Prep.” At first
glance Mimi had interpreted the back handed phrase
as “To my Pup.” She laughed aloud. She was reading
the cards a second time. Surely that was all the
packages but she was wrong. The too big surprise
was coming up the steps now. Such a big box Mrs.
Cole was having the janitor bring it up. Plop! He
put it down beside Mimi’s bed.</p>

<p class='c010' >“That’s right.” Mrs. Cole was directing behind
him. “That’s the girl.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Miss MIMI HAMMOND,” the janitor read
slowly.</p>

<p class='c010' >The only reason Mimi didn’t guess was because,
Christmas or any other time she wore an air of
expecting-something-nice-to-happen. So often it did.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Thank you.”</p>

<p class='c010' >This looked like a crate of oranges. She could
make out from the express label that whatever it
was, it came from Bowling Green. Grand! Then
a wave of suspicion swept over her. This might be
a prank. Not too many years ago when Sue played in
her first recital, Mimi herself had thought up the
joke of sending Sue a box of weeds. Sue, unsuspecting,
had opened them before her friends and cried
with embarrassment. Come to think of it, Sue had
left no present. Maybe&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class='c010' >“I’ll pry the lid off, Miss,” the janitor was saying
as he reached in his hip pocket for a hammer.</p>

<p class='c010' >The squeak of the first nail drawn commanded
silence. Every one in the room who could be up
out of bed hovered near. The others sat up and
craned their necks. Mimi with one hand held her
robe together at the throat and with the other was
squeezing the end of the pillow behind her back into
a tight ball. Hurry, janitor, hurry but don’t get a
splinter in your finger.</p>

<p class='c010' >When he pulled the top off, the first thing Mimi
saw was oranges, a whole half crate of them. It was
a joke after all. Anyone with any sense would know
that after four days of flu she never wanted to see
an orange again. But what was under the red tissue
covering the other half? One hand to her head to
guard against dizzying weakness, Mimi peeked under
the red paper. Presents, a whole array of them daintily
tied up in green cellophane with silver ribbons
and stars; almost the green and white of Sheridan.
Mimi’s hands shook as she opened the note which
lay unsealed atop the presents:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A gift a day</div>
      <div class='line'>keeps the blues away.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010' >The instructions followed. There was one package
to be opened each day beginning now, Christmas,
and every day thereafter until the holidays were
over. The presents were labeled by days. She would
find no cards as they had been bought by them all.
The signatures which followed, Mimi kept and a year
later they were the first page of the autograph book
she prized so highly. Sue had planned the box, of
course. She had rushed home breathless with the
news that Mimi was quarantined. Dottie had taken
charge (Mimi could picture her ordering the others
around) and under Miss Jane’s supervision the gifts
had been assembled. Racing down the list of names
Mimi’s eyes clouded. A round tear splashed down
and blurred the second name. She read, Miss Jane
and Dick, Dottie, Jean, Margie, Sue, Miss Millie, and
the last two surprised her most of all&mdash;Honky and
Mammy Cissy. Bless their hearts! She had had
none of Tiny Tim’s spirit when she awakened, but
now she was so touched by the thoughtfulness of her
friends that she wanted to say aloud. “God bless you
everyone. Bless Mother and Daddy and Sonny,”
she tagged on at the end as if it were her bedtime
prayer. Dottie had rounded them up to make the
days come out correctly. One-two-three-four-five-six-seven-eight&mdash;eight
days and Sue would be back
knowing a thousand things Mimi was eager to find
out.</p>

<p class='c010' >How the days ever would have gone by without a
daily surprise Mimi did not know. That certainly
helped. She had been like old King Cole calling
for his pipe and calling for his bowl. The difference
was Mimi called for a “’sprise” and Nurse
brought one. Now that she was better, writing letters
of thanks filled much of her time. She used Tumble
Inn stationery and sealed the envelopes with green
wax imprinted with an old English “S.” Something
else happened that helped more than that. Miss
Millie paid her a “pop call”! That capped the climax.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi had been sitting in a big chair all wrapped
up in her bathrobe studying. Yes, studying. But
alas that Source Book. Every time she settled down
to outside reading something happened.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Pahdon Mah southe’n accent but is you all studyin’?”</p>

<p class='c010' >Head around the door one second asking, the next
entering and hugging Mimi, flu and all. That was
Miss Millie, next-to-Miss-Jane-the-best-counsellor-in-the-world.</p>

<p class='c010' >Blam!</p>

<p class='c010' >Source Book to the floor&mdash;</p>

<p class='c010' >“Millie&mdash;Oh&mdash;Millie! Am I seeing things?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“No, ’tis I, Millie, former skipper of the Cuckoo’s
Nest on Green River and now the most dignified
member of the faculty ’way down yonder where I
teach.”</p>

<p class='c010' >It wouldn’t be Miss Millie if she wasn’t clowning.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I hardly recognize you without your silly sailor
hat but oh, Millie! Tell me the news. Where have
you been? Where are you going? And that rudest
question of all, how long can you stay?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Large order but I’ll try. I have been in Bowling
Green for Christmas, am en route to the high
school where I earn my daily bread, can stay here
fifteen minutes. There is a taxi waiting at your door
now. He promised to get me to the train in plenty
of time. If I stay a second past my allotted fifteen
minutes he is to begin blowing and not stop until I
appear. One way for a homely girl to cause a panic.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Millie, you’re not homely. You look wonderful
to me. I never was so glad to see any one! Don’t
waste a minute. Tell me everything. How is Miss
Jane?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“You should see her apartment. The McIntosh’s
moved out of Mrs. Herold’s house so Jane has her
own apartment but she still lives at home. She has
everything Early American. Maple beds pegged
together instead of screwed or nailed. An elegant
Chintz chaise longue with soft pillows. You just
sink down to heaven in it. I had tea with Jane and
sat on it. She says that after supper she and Dick
scramble for it but usually end up by <i>both</i> of them
sitting on it. She looks prettier than she ever did in
her life&mdash;rested, fresh and has more pep! She’s been
making curtains, made a tufted candlewick bed spread,
and now is hooking a rug&mdash;whatta’ gal!”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Isn’t she though?”</p>

<p class='c010' >One by one Mimi went down the list. How was
each? Who gave parties? What was served? What
was worn?</p>

<p class='c010' >When Millie sprang up and jerked her hat forward
at the first honk of the taxi, there were still things
left unsaid.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Muchas gracias&mdash;er-r-r&mdash;for the presents,”
Mimi added in English&mdash;“and adios.”</p>

<p class='c010' >She was grateful for the presents and she hated
to say goodbye. But it had been an interesting visit.
Next to the excitement of opening all the presents,
Millie’s “pop call” was the high light of the holidays.
One can weary even of holidays but they would soon
be over now. Nurse had promised Mimi she could
meet the trains and she could hardly wait.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Imagine me, me of all people, anxious for holidays
to end, but I am, Nursie, I sincerely am.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXV' class='c008'>CHAPTER XV<br /> <br />DADDY SENDS A CLUE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009' >“Did you have a good time with Aunt Marcia,
Chloe?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Er-r&mdash;certainly, Mimi. Why do you ask?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Nothing.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi blushed. She could not fib with a straight
face. She edged around keeping her back away from
Chloe as she was clutching behind her a letter which
had just come from Daddy. Perhaps it was the effect
of the letter but it seemed to Mimi, Chloe had looked
disturbed and paler since the holidays. In contrast
to her wistful dark eyes, her skin seemed ivory white.
The other girls had come back sparkling and glowing,
telling and re-telling good times they experienced at
home. Betsy was radiant. Sue was voluble. The
first night she was back Mrs. Cole had had to rap
sharply on the door of Tumble Inn to stop the talking
after light-bell. They hadn’t given Chloe a
chance to get a word in edge ways had she wanted it.
Mimi had waited hopefully for the slightest word
from her but none had come. She had to pull to get
much out of Chloe.</p>

<p class='c010' >“You didn’t have an opportunity to ask Aunt Marcia&mdash;anything&mdash;important?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“What could I ask, Mimi?” Chloe countered. “The
once or twice I have broached the topic Aunt Marcia
has hedged or changed the subject. She was so kind
Christmas and seemed so happy to have me with her.
She must be awfully lonely, too, or she never would
have adopted me. She tried to plan things I’d like
but right in the middle of whatever we’d be doing I’d
think&mdash;you’re not my Aunt, you’re not even kin to
me! Who are you?”&mdash;Chloe was choking&mdash;“Who
am <i>I</i>?”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi hugged Chloe close. Chloe did not shrink.
She laid her beautiful, tired head against Mimi and
sobbed.</p>

<p class='c010' >“You are somebody beautiful and sweet and lovely.
We all love you, no matter who your Mother and
Father were.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I know they were fine, too, Mimi. But it’s this
awful suspense of not knowing. I might have brothers
and sisters and pass right by them any day and
not know them. My mother must be tortured imagining
horrible things have happened to me. I’d&mdash;I’d rather&mdash;believe&mdash;she
is dead than that she has
worried about me all these years.”</p>

<p class='c010' >The letter which Mimi had quickly thrust in her
belt when she took Chloe in her arms, crackled as
the two girls sat down on the bed. Both the chairs
and the vanity stool were piled up. Everything was
topsy-turvy in term-end confusion.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi was more upset than anything around her.
The letter had brought her a spark of hope, so dim,
so faint she dared not tell. Yet Chloe needed to
know so badly; which would be worse, to give her
a ray of hope that in all probability would be shattered
or leave her as she was without anything to
cling to? If she should tell Chloe she had told
Daddy, Chloe might not like it. She might not feel
as Mimi did, that any great secret could be shared
with your parents without breaking your promise.
Mimi could keep secrets. She had struggled hard
and won to keep from telling Millie. She had never
told Betsy about Madge and the alarm bell. But
Chloe was again sobbing softly against her. She
trembled delicately as Pluto, the crow, had trembled
in Mimi’s hands while Daddy patched his broken
wing. Poor Chloe! A wounded dark bird snatched
from her nest before she could fly.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Would you know Fritzie if you saw him or saw
a picture of him, Chloe?”</p>

<p class='c010' >She needed a more tangible clue. Something she
could tell Daddy definitely yes and no about.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I’ve often wondered. You see, it’s been so very
long ago. I was so tiny. I remember how I laughed
at the pictures tattooed on his arms&mdash;a lady on one and
a sailor on the other. He’d hold them together and
we’d play they were dancing. He cackled instead of
laughing. When I think back the only picture I have
is that blurred one of my mother&mdash;hear her frantic
screams. Voices&mdash;I’d KNOW HIS VOICE, Mimi.
I know I would.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Encouraged by her decision Chloe continued.</p>

<p class='c010' >“When I get in college, I’m going to take psychology.
I read it in the library every chance I get now.
When I am old enough to travel by myself I’m going
everywhere hunting places and faces that seem familiar.
Oh, Mimi, I’ve thought about it so much!
Maybe, some day, when I’m sure Fritzie and the short
man and big old Freida are dead and can’t hurt us any
more, I may write my story and have my picture made
and published.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“When Fritzie is dead.” Mimi repeated slowly.
The words in Daddy’s letter danced before her eyes.
Should she tell? Daddy had written at great length
about Chloe’s story.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Chloe, would you care if you knew that I had
written my Daddy ALL about you?” She didn’t wait
for a reply. “You see, I have, and I hope you won’t
think I’ve broken my word. I haven’t told another
living soul and shan’t. But Daddy is interested in
your case and says he will help. The night you told
us your story, I swore never to quit until we knew
who you really were but I didn’t know where to start.
That same night I wrote Daddy. He can do anything.
Already he is planning what to do and how
to do it.”</p>

<p class='c010' >But Mimi quit there and kept the contents of the
letter secret. After asking Chloe several pointed
questions, the answers to which were not satisfactory,
she talked slowly toward the library to write Daddy
in the quiet where she could think clearly.</p>

<p class='c010' >As she passed College Hall the smell of black coffee
came floating out. Cram week was causing a panic
Ghostly figures with notebooks, unfinished themes,
and reference books had been slipping through the
corridors after lights out. Laggards were drinking
strong coffee now trying to keep awake long enough
to learn a few more answers. The gym was deserted
except at class periods. Sue had cut practice hours
twice in a row. Betsy was “boning” as she had never
done before but the College girls were the busier.</p>

<p class='c010' >Let them slave Mimi thought. Thank goodness
she had caught up with lessons while she was quarantined.</p>

<p class='c010' >She ignored the librarian as she entered. With a
grand disregard for the cramming going on all about
her, Mimi unscrewed the top of her fountain pen.
This letter to Daddy is far more important. It is the
most important document I’ve ever written. I must
think straight. I must tell every little detail that
might help, the tattooed figures, the cackling laugh.
But first I must answer his questions.</p>

<p class='c010' >Unfolding the fat letter and rearranging the pages
carefully so that the questions were on top, Mimi
shook her pen twice and began to write feverishly.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVI' class='c008'>CHAPTER XVI<br /> <br />THE LAKE FREEZES OVER</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009' >When the rising bell rang, Sue counted three, then
kicked off the covers. She sprang out of bed to pull
down the window leaving Betsy shivering.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Cruel world.” Betsy groaned wriggling further
down in bed and reaching for the covers.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Cruel nothing,” Sue retorted. “You fresh air
fiends will be the death of me yet. Pick the coldest
night of the year to throw the window to the top.”</p>

<p class='c010' >For two reasons Betsy could hardly hear the last
of Sue’s tirade. She had covered up head, ears and
all. Sue had run in the bathroom to dress where
it was warmer and had closed the door.</p>

<p class='c010' >“What’s all the commotion?” Mimi asked. The
bell had awakened her but she had not stirred. If
she moved out of her warm place she touched cold
sheets.</p>

<p class='c010' >“The greatest disaster in contemporary history,”
came Betsy’s muffled voice from the adjoining bed.
“On this, perhaps the only <i>Friday</i> morning of the
year when we could miss breakfast and stay in bed
our energetic friend, Sue, has to sound a triple alarm
and fire a nineteen gun salute! Sue,” she yelled
poking her head out, “I hope you’re freezing.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“What’s this rot about not getting up?”</p>

<p class='c010' >Sue, fully dressed opened the bathroom door and
entered, a glass of cold water in her hand.</p>

<p class='c010' >“We’re not getting up! Don’t tell me the fact
that one may cut breakfast and enjoy a little free time
today because of term-end failed to penetrate your
skull?”</p>

<p class='c010' >Betsy was wide awake and chattering away just
because she wished she were sleepy. All eyes fixed
with dread on the glass of water; she, Mimi, and
Chloe watched Sue’s expression sag.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Woe is me! I did forget. Move over Betsy I’m
coming back to bed clothes and all.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Sue set the glass on the floor took one jump and
landed in bed. Betsy swirled and spiraled and succeeded
in wrapping all the covers around her. Sue
pulled and jerked without success.</p>

<p class='c010' >“All right, I’ll get in with Chloe and Mimi.
They’re not old meanies.”</p>

<p class='c010' >But they were. They held tightly to their covers.
Sue went to the foot of the bed, loosened the covers
and started reaching for their feet. The fight was
on. Zip-whizz! Betsy threw a pillow barely missing
Sue’s bobbing head.</p>

<p class='c010' >The five minute bell rang. Sue gave up.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Three against one is no fair. I’m going to breakfast
and I hope we have waffles and country sausage
and maple syrup and pineapple juice and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class='c010' >Blam!</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi’s pillow struck Sue’s retreating figure.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Go eat grits! Scram!”</p>

<p class='c010' >But Sue had roused Mimi. She jumped up.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Come on let’s go to breakfast. I could dress for
my wedding in five minutes.”</p>

<p class='c010' >When the last bell rang the three were within a
half dozen steps of the dining room door. Betsy was
pulling the comb through her hair. Chloe was
straightening her tie and Mimi was tugging at her
stocking but they got in before the door closed.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Gee! I’m glad we came,” Mimi sighed.</p>

<p class='c010' >She was so full she could hardly speak. More than
half the girls were taking advantage of their term-end
privilege and had stayed away so there were
seconds and thirds! Of course, the menu wasn’t all
Sue had pictured but they did have pineapple juice for
a change and Mimi had two servings. While she
was too full to do much talking, Mimi could sit back
and listen. She wouldn’t have missed Miss Bassett’s
announcement for anything.</p>

<p class='c010' >“May I have your attention, please?”</p>

<p class='c010' >The girls turned toward Miss Bassett, anticipation
in their faces. Her announcements were always
good news&mdash;game schedules, pep squad meetings,
hikes or something enjoyable. The one she made today
was one she had not made for four years! She
might not get to make it for four more or longer
because the winters were not as severe as they used to
be.</p>

<p class='c010' >“The manager of Wildwood Park has telephoned
that the lake is frozen solid. The temperature is
dropping steadily and the forecast for tomorrow is
continued fair and colder. <i>If</i> there is six or more
inches of good ice on the lake, we will have a skating
party tomorrow.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Clap! Clap! Clap! Cries of approval. Mimi
clapped loudest.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I am going out to Wildwood today to see for myself
how the ice looks. In the meantime all girls
interested in ice skating sign the sheet on the bulletin
board. Only those girls who are well and warmly
dressed will be permitted to go. This is not a definite
promise but know this. I want to go as badly as you
do, maybe more.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi never doubted the weather man an instant.
She felt sure, too, that Miss Bassett would not have
mentioned the party at all unless she was practically
sure the ice would hold. Mimi’s worry was not the
temperature, it was getting some ice skates. Here
at last was a chance to learn how to do something she
had always wanted to know how to do. She realized
that there would be only a limited number of skates
available and she would have to think fast. That
she could borrow a pair was unlikely. Any girl who
liked skating enough to own a pair and lug them
around with her when there was so little chance of
skating in this climate, would be using her own. There
was but one thing to do, buy a pair and buy them now
before the hardware and sporting goods stores sold
out. She had not done one extravagant thing since
Daddy and Mother had been gone but she was going
to spend practically her whole month’s allowance at
one crack.</p>

<p class='c010' >All this had flashed quickly through her mind.
Breakfast was over and in another few minutes the
girls would start a mad search for skates. Somehow
she must get the jump on them. The college girls
could go right on to town without permission. Oh,
dear! There seemed but one thing to do and Mimi
did it immediately and successfully.</p>

<p class='c010' >Slapping her napkin quickly to her mouth as if
to suppress a hiccough she jerked her head and stood
up. Making signs to the hostess she excused herself.
As she passed Mrs. Cole’s table, still pressing the
napkin to her lips, she hiccoughed out loud. As soon
as she passed out the double glass doors she dropped
the napkin and ran.</p>

<p class='c010' >She went as straight to the office as she could.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Please, please,” she pleaded breathlessly to the
girl at the desk, “phone Sweirs for me. Here I’ll
find the number.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Her fingers flew-P-Q-R-S-Sa-Se-Sw&mdash;Sweirs&mdash;She
could hear the girls now coming down the hall as
she gave the number.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Please ask if they have any ice skates to fit a size
five boot.”</p>

<p class='c010' >The girl was so impressed by Mimi’s excitement,
it never occurred to her she did not have permission
to telephone. But Mimi knew she did not have; that
was why she was having the girl call for her. Hurry!
Hurry! How long did it take Sweirs to answer?
They must be terribly busy&mdash;probably selling all their
skates.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Sweirs are sorry. They have no ice skates.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi groaned.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Then we’ll call the hardware stores.” She was
fumbling through the directory again.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Look in the classified section in the back,” the
girl suggested.</p>

<p class='c010' >H-Hardware. There. She had another number.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Yes, size five please,” the girl was saying. “Just
a moment.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Putting her hand over the transmitter she turned
to Mimi.</p>

<p class='c010' >“He has some. What shall I say?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Have him send them out collect&mdash;and special
delivery.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Ten or twenty-five cents more wouldn’t matter.
Mimi couldn’t wait.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Bring your money to the office now so that I can
pay the boy.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Thank you. Thank you so much.”</p>

<p class='c010' >The money. Mimi was down to earth again. She
was taking one problem at a time and doing splendidly
but she was up against something now. She
had only one dollar and seventy-five cents in her
purse and that was not enough. She had forgotten
about buying three cans of heat, the brown sugar and
the movie magazines.</p>

<p class='c010' >Knowing full well that no girl in school is as
despised as one who borrows, she risked her popularity
to raise the money. Everywhere it was the same.
Term end was a time of celebration and each girl
Mimi asked needed all she had and more.</p>

<p class='c010' >There was but one thing left to do. She went
back to Tumble Inn and taking the key from around
her neck she unlocked the secret drawer of her trunk
where she kept her diary. She took out one of the
blank checks Daddy had left her for emergencies.
It would be the first one she had used and she was
spending it on something frivolous but after all,
Daddy wanted her to have a good time. He’d be
the first person to say, “Go ahead and get them,
Honey.” She felt very important as she made out
the check in the office. In her best writing she signed
Dr. J. S. Hammond by Mimi. Her name ran
sideways off the bottom of the check.</p>

<p class='c010' >The thirty minutes she loafed around where she
could see the office entrance and pounce upon the
messenger and grab her skates, she had time to think.</p>

<p class='c010' >She had been very selfish. She had thought only
of getting skates for herself. What about her suite
mates? She could have ordered theirs at the same
time. One special delivery fee would have brought
them all. Sorry that she had been so thoughtless
she raced upstairs to make amends and was not in
the office when the skates were delivered.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Did you ever hear of anything grander?” Betsy
asked as she dangled a pair of rusty skates. “Jill says
if I’ll clean them, I can use them. She is going on
that sketching party Chloe is going on.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“You mean you’re not going skating, Chloe.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Is that so strange? I’m going hiking all right
and will be in on the food but while you all skate,
some of us are going to sketch, if our fingers aren’t
too numb. You might be posing for me for all you
know.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I’m not going skating either,” Sue declared.
“Olivia had already invited me to the matinee and
had gotten special permission. She is giving a movie
party. Five of us are going and&mdash;without a chaperon!”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Well blow me down!” Mimi declared. “Imagine
doing anything else when one could ice skate,
especially an ordinary thing like seeing a movie.”
She slapped her hands together in front of her.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Betsy, outside quick&mdash;idea!”</p>

<p class='c010' >They whispered together, then dashed off.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Oh, if only Miss Bassett hasn’t left yet!” Mimi
cried. Miss Bassett was still in her room and she
listened to their plan with interest. Mimi’s enthusiasm
was always contagious. To hear her talking
with Miss Bassett, her suggested menu of bean hole
beans for the skaters tomorrow would be the most
sumptuous feast mortals ever ate. Here was the
plan she and Betsy had hatched up.</p>

<p class='c010' >It was Friday morning now. The skating party
was slated for midday tomorrow. Mimi and Betsy
posted a notice of a surprise dinner&mdash;price fifteen
cents a skater. They delegated Madge and Janice
to collect. Miss Bassett advanced money for
purchase of supplies. She postponed her trip to Wildwood
until the girls could buy the beans and put
them to soak. Then armed with hand axe, shovel,
matches and a hand full of kindling to make sure,
they drove out to Wildwood to dig the bean hole.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Gee! It’s grand riding. I haven’t been in a
car since Thanksgiving,” Mimi avowed. “Hadn’t
ridden in one then since September. Can you
imagine?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I’m glad you’re enjoying it. But about the beans.
Mimi, you know that if they are not good the whole
party will be spoiled and I should hate that.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“You go ahead and talk to the man, Miss Bassett.
Leave the beans to us. They’ll be good, I can
promise.”</p>

<p class='c010' >The way Mimi declared herself Miss Bassett knew
she could depend on her. Dumping the girls and
their “field artillery” as they called it, she went on
her own errand.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi was in her glory. She had on her boots
and old breeches and three sweaters and was giving
Betsy orders right and left. She was working hard
herself. While Betsy gathered wood and searched
for flat stones, Mimi dug the hole. She selected
an open place where there would be no danger of
damaging a tree or starting a fire. After a half hour
of digging in the frozen ground she had finished a
hole the size of a card table. It was deeper than the
ten gallon kettle the beans were soaking in and it
was deeper in the center. While she rested, Betsy
lined the center of the hole with flat stones. On
top of these Betsy built a fire.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Stack it loosely so it can get plenty of air to burn.
Light it on the windward side.” Mimi had to let
Betsy know how much she knew about fire lore. She
hoped, however, she did not act like Jean and wear a
show-off, I-have-been-to-camp-before manner.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Why the windy side?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“The wind will blow the fire under and it will
catch all through. There. See? Now put on plenty
of big wood so that we will have lots of good live coals
when we get back. We’ll ask the man to watch it
while we are gone.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Isn’t that some fire?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Perfect. I just love fire.” She meant this kind
you could warm by and cook over; not the destructive,
terrifying kind she was to know soon. Mimi stretched
out her hands to it. “I never see it without repeating
to myself, ‘The Ode to Fire.’ I was saying it as you
kneeled to light this one.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I love that too.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“There comes Miss Bassett. Let’s go meet her
so she won’t have to get off the drive. These frozen
ruts are rough.”</p>

<p class='c010' >All the way to town Mimi kept wondering if the
beans were softening. She preferred to soak them
all night but as Cissy so often said, circumstances alter
cases. She had left them in warm, soft water. That
would help. It would be better to soak them less
and cook them longer rather than take a chance on
cooking them in the morning and hoping they’d be
done by noon. Long slow cooking was best.</p>

<p class='c010' >Back at Sheridan and in the kitchen, Mimi took
charge again.</p>

<p class='c010' >First she drained the water off of the beans. Then
she poured part of them into a crock. She sliced the
salt pork in thin chunks and laid it in carefully. Then
she sprinkled a layer of brown sugar, ripe tomato
ketchup and salt. More beans&mdash;meat, sugar, salt,
ketchup. On and on until the great kettle was half
full and the crock was empty. Then she poured in
hot water until the kettle was full. The beans had
not softened much. Mimi was worried; she had
given Miss Bassett her word.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I’ll tell you what we’ll do; leave them on the
stove to simmer until Miss Bassett blows for us.
That way they’ll be hot through and through and
will get a good start.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Do you suppose any one has caught on?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I hope not.”</p>

<p class='c010' >No one found out, although several wondered what
Betsy and Mimi were doing, going out with Miss
Bassett for the second time. What could be in that
huge kettle which was so heavy one of the kitchen
negroes had to lift it on the running board?</p>

<p class='c010' >Miss Bassett drove slowly but Mimi held her
breath. Mustn’t “spill the beans” she cautioned.
She had the window rolled down and was holding on
to the handle. Once or twice on curves the pot pulled
and swung out dangerously near slipping off but
eventually they managed to deposit the kettle near
the bean hole.</p>

<p class='c010' >The fire had died to glowing embers. Mimi must
be careful. She shoveled them out of the hole and
piled them to one side. Then handing Betsy a thick
pad, she took one herself and together they settled the
pot on the hot stones. Making sure the lid was
clamped down tight, Mimi covered the pot with a
wet grass sack. Then she shoveled the hot coals on
top of the sack and over them, threw the loose dirt.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Looks like a new grave,” Betsy teased.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Why Betsy! You should be ashamed! Besides,
you never saw a grave with little wisps of smoke
curling out.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Ready, girls? You know it’s Friday and we
dress for dinner.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi paid little attention to her toilette that evening.
Of course, it was always a relief to get out of
her uniform but she had put on her boots to try on
her skates. She volunteered to be last in the bathroom
and spent her time trying to balance herself on
them until the last minute. When she finally started
to dress her suite mates had dressed and gone. There
was no one to pull her boots off. She tugged and
tugged. For the second time that day she entered
the dining room just as the doors were being closed.</p>

<p class='c010' >After dinner she went to the sing song but only
her body was there. All her interest was simmering
in a bean hole at Wildwood. She did do one thing
that was fun. After the sing song she linked arms
with Betsy and they strolled up and down the hall
passing and repassing the open double doors into the
parlors. They were looking in on the Friday night
“dates.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Even if I could and some boy wanted to come, I
wouldn’t have a date like that for anything.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“You won’t have one because you don’t like boys.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Yes, I do,” Mimi declared. “Better than girls
in lots of ways, but if you mean I’m not boy crazy,
thanks. I’m not and hope I never am.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Well, I’d have at date, even like that, if some
one would ask me,” Betsy concluded as they went up
to Tumble Inn.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi retired early so that tomorrow would come
more quickly. Morning came almost too soon, for
Mimi awakened much earlier than usual and thought
the rising bell would never sound. In the still hour
of dawn, as in moments when she wakened in the
night, she wondered about Chloe and prayed brief,
but tenderly sincere prayers.</p>

<p class='c010' >Up and dressed she paced up, down, and around
from the time breakfast was over until the party was
off. She made at least six trips up and down the
steps. She turned in money to Miss Bassett. She
lost and found her skate key. But at last, at eleven
o’clock, she arrived with the party at Wildwood Park.</p>

<p class='c010' >Even now she was afraid something would happen
to interfere with the skating. She watched Miss Bassett
strap on her skates and with the man beside her
glide across the ice stopping here and there and
tapping with a heavy stick. Contrary to the forecast,
it was not as cold as it had been yesterday and the sun
had been bright all morning. Miss Bassett looked a
bit worried when they returned to the bonfire and
although the manager insisted the whole lake was
safe, Miss Bassett drew a dead line.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Not doubting your word at all, but I can keep up
with half a lake full of girls better than a whole lakeful.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Just as you say. I’ll stretch ropes.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi was the first to get her skates on, but having
them on she sat helpless on a log. One by one the
girls put their skates on and hobbled past. No one
dreamed Mimi could not skate. She could do everything
else athletic outdoors and indoors, too, it
seemed.</p>

<p class='c010' >She watched miserably. Finally Madge saw her.
Frail little Madge was swooping and dipping and
swirling like a brown bird. She beckoned to Mimi.
“Come on.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I don’t know how.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Come on. I’ll help you.”</p>

<p class='c010' >After two bad starts Mimi hip-hopped over to the
lake’s edge and held out her hands to Madge.
“Steady.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I hope I don’t pull you down.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“You won’t.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I can skate well on roller skates and if you hold
me till I get the hang of it, I’ll be all right.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Sure you will. Now&mdash;Skim, don’t push.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Under Madge’s patient direction, she was gaining
poise and balance. But the first venture she made
alone was disastrous.</p>

<p class='c010' >They had tried to keep to the edge of the crowd
and were so absorbed in Mimi’s strokes, that by the
time Mimi was ready to let go Madge’s steadying
hands, they were within a few feet of the rope.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Now see if you can go by yourself,” Madge said
giving Mimi a good shove to start her.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi took four uncertain strokes, crashed into the
rope and fell hard. She slipped several feet beyond
where she had hit the ice so hard. Speeding behind
to assist her, Madge caught her toe in the crack where
Mimi had hit. At the second impact the ice gave way.</p>

<p class='c010' >Madge did not fall all the way through. Mimi
could tell that from where she was sprawled. Raising
quickly, she tore off her skates and started running
toward Madge. She took two steps and halted. If
the ice were thin it would crack more under her added
and greater weight. Madge, who was in no immediate
danger, had not cried out. She was wedged
in a hole, one leg through the ice, her head and
body above.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Help,” Mimi screamed. “Help. Bring a plank.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Instead of getting a board, most of the skaters
darted toward Madge. Quickly, Mimi ran a wide
circle around her and headed them off. This accident
so far was not bad but unless they were cautious it
could be.</p>

<p class='c010' >Madge was sobbing now.</p>

<p class='c010' >“My leg is freezing.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“We’ll have you out in a minute,” Mimi called
reassuringly. “Be as still as you can, so you won’t make
any more cracks. Stop, girls! Miss Bassett, please
keep them back,” Mimi pleaded. “Here comes Dit
with a plank and we’ll have her out in a jiffy.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi helped Dit slip the board along the ice
until Madge could clutch it with her numb little
hands.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Can you pull out or shall I ease out and help?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I-can-make it&mdash;I think&mdash;”</p>

<p class='c010' >Madge was pulling hard but her heavy clothes
made her clumsy. Mimi stretched out on her
stomach and inched closer. She held out one hand
to Madge and clung to the board with the other.
Dit was holding the board. Miss Bassett had sent
for her car and was watching the rescue tensely. At
the slightest misstep she would interfere.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I’ve got you, Madge. Steady. You pull and
I’ll pull.”</p>

<p class='c010' >As Madge’s leg finally came up, there was a sickening
rip and cracking; the ice around her had given
way. Girls screamed as the dark water became visible
through the rapidly widening cracks. Madge was
submerged to the neck but she held desperately to
the board and Mimi had her firmly by the wrist.
Calling directions to Dit about the board, Mimi lifted
with all her might as Dit jerked the board. Out came
Madge skidding across the crackled ice toward them,
leaving a trail of slush behind. Her brown suede
jacket, her brown pants and boots soaked, she looked
like a baby seal. She was more helpless.</p>

<p class='c010' >Quickly Miss Bassett rolled her in a blanket and
lifting this frailest of the Preps in her arms she
carried her to the car. The engine was running.
Mimi and Dit followed panting.</p>

<p class='c010' >“We can take care of her, Miss Bassett. Let me
drive her in. Mimi can help. You stay and see to
the others.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Thank you, Dit. Will that be all right, Madge?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Sure. I’m not hurt. I’m just c-c-cold and wet.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Betsy can serve the beans,” Mimi called back as
an after thought. Beans seemed as far away as
Germany. She was pulling off Madge’s wet boots
and rubbing her numb foot and leg.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Thawing up?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Little bit.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I feel like a clumsy ox! Making you fa’ down
and go boom!”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I should have been watching.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I’d have died if anything had have happened to
you,” Mimi shuddered.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Don’t say anything about death,” Madge gasped.
She was so white around the mouth, Mimi feared she
might faint. It was different from the purple
splotches from being cold. There was a haunted
look in her eyes. She lowered her voice so Dit
couldn’t hear.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I knew something awful was going to happen today,”
she confided.</p>

<p class='c010' >“How did you know?”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi was thinking of Cissy and her spooky premonitions.
The very thoughts of them made goose
bumps on Mimi.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Ever since last night when I hear those”&mdash;her
voice sank to a stricken whisper&mdash;“death bells!”</p>

<p class='c010' >There was horror and conviction in her voice.</p>

<p class='c010' >“What on earth are death bells?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Sh-sh-sh&mdash;I’ll tell you some time&mdash;maybe.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Was Sheridan a boarding school or a lunatic
asylum, Mimi wondered as they neared the winter
stripped campus and stopped before Prep Hall.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVII' class='c008'>CHAPTER XVII<br /> <br />SATURDAY ESCAPADE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009' >For Mimi, the next few days rolled slowly into a
week. There was constant fear that Madge would
yet develop flu or pneumonia. Frail appearing people
were not always delicate, Mimi concluded when
a week passed and Madge had not so much as sneezed.
Mimi, in her concern, had hovered near for days.
Just like an old hen with one chicken, Mimi told
herself. She could better understand how Mother
Dear fussed and fumed over her when she had “been
exposed.” All week, too, she had her eyes peeled for
a letter postmarked in Germany. It was too soon to
hear from Daddy but she couldn’t keep from watching
and hoping. The second semester was well under
way and the routine of a new schedule was becoming
habit.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Betsy,” Mimi exclaimed the third Saturday after
the skating party, “I have to do something exciting
or bust!”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I feel a fit coming on, too,” Betsy agreed sprawling
on the bed in a grotesque pose.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Let’s do something about it,” Mimi laughed.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Name it. ‘Barkus is willing.’”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Yes. Name it. What is there to do within these
four walls that we have not tried? We have raided
the kitchen at all hours, cooked after light bell, invaded
College Hall, used the telephone without permission,
cut assembly&mdash;all of it.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“None of that is very devilish. I want to do something
wild and woolly.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Like slip away from the campus!”</p>

<p class='c010' >Once the words were out Mimi clapped her hand
over her mouth. It was too late. She had said the
very thing both of them were thinking.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Would we dare?” Betsy breathed. Her blue eye
was glittering, her brown eye clouded with fear.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Dare? Madam! Is that a challenge? Did I
ever take a dare?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Not since I’ve known you.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“This will not be an exception. Let the ‘ways and
means committee’ meet at once.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Uh&mdash;Oh! What’s up?” Sue cried as she and
Chloe came in. Sue slung her books at the table.
Chloe put hers in a neat stack. “Dirty work afoot at
the cross roads. I can tell by the smooth and oily
waves,” she made rippling motions with her arms and
hands, “that a storm is brewing. Why are your
heads so close together, amigas mias? Confess.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Betsy and Mimi flushed guiltily.</p>

<p class='c010' >“We’d better tell them so that if anything happens&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class='c010' >Her pert face a question mark, Mimi was looking
at Betsy.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Yes, we’d better,” Betsy agreed.</p>

<p class='c010' >“We are breaking jail,” Mimi said tersely.</p>

<p class='c010' >“When?” from Sue.</p>

<p class='c010' >“How?” from Chloe.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Right after lunch.” from Betsy.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Disguised and out the servant’s entrance.” from
Mimi.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Well blow us down!” from Sue and Chloe.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Don’t stand there paralyzed,” Mimi ordered.
Now that the decision was made she was eager for
action. “Y’all will have to help us borrow our disguises
but first, cross your hearts and promise not to
tell a soul.”</p>

<p class='c010' >The promise was given. They wished they had
courage to join in but they were ruled out at the
first suggestion. Four people would be too conspicuous.
Two might prove too many.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi could hardly swallow her lunch. The fated
hour of two o’clock would never come. This was the
hour washwomen waited for girls to claim laundry
and to pay.</p>

<p class='c010' >As soon as the bread pudding dishes were empty
and every possible taste of chocolate sauce scraped up,
the four occupants of Tumble Inn hastened to their
suite and closed the door.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Shall we lock it?” Chloe asked.</p>

<p class='c010' >“No,” Betsy answered promptly. “Pile things
against it so that it would take a minute or two to get
in but don’t lock it. If Mrs. Cole tried it and it
didn’t open she’d ‘smell a mouse’ sure enough.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi laughed aloud as she had a mental picture of
Mrs. Cole wrinkling up her nose and sniffing. Any
kind of conspiracy intrigued her and she set about
changing her appearance in high glee.</p>

<p class='c010' >From girls larger than they, they had borrowed
skirts and long coats. Even their shoes were so
large and run over, Mimi’s feet flapped like Charlie
Chaplin’s as she moved nearer the mirror.</p>

<p class='c010' >“My own Mother wouldn’t know me,” she commented.</p>

<p class='c010' >“No, but Mrs. Cole will unless you do something
about that unruly mop of red hair,” Sue contradicted.</p>

<p class='c010' >Here was a problem. A beret would expose her
features. The hair was not long enough to tuck
under a hat with a brim and stay up. Regardless of
the number of bobby pins put in, drake tails kept
slipping down around Mimi’s neck.</p>

<p class='c010' >Then Chloe had an inspiration.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Wear a veil. Lots of the colored people do.”</p>

<p class='c010' >There was a fifteen minute search for a veil. At
that, a makeshift was used. Chloe draped a piece
of black georgette around the crown of the hat and
let it hang over where the red hair shone the brightest.</p>

<p class='c010' >By the time Mimi was ready, Betsy was practically
losing her skirt. When she moved toward the door
it fell at her feet. Another five minute search. Sue
dashing about borrowing safety pins. Now Betsy
switched her hips rapidly like a Spanish dancer but
the skirt stayed in place.</p>

<p class='c010' >Looking more like caricatures or comic valentines
than bona fide servants, the two girls ventured forth.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi trembled and held her breath while Sue
opened the door and peered down the hall. Getting
safely from Tumble Inn to the service entrance was
the most hazardous part of the whole journey. Once
they reached the entrance they could run&mdash;oh how
they could run&mdash;if there was danger of being recognized.</p>

<p class='c010' >“The coast is clear,” Sue announced.</p>

<p class='c010' >Looking squarely into each other’s eyes, the two
silently pledged loyalty and secrecy. Mimi understood
as clearly as if Betsy had said aloud, “No matter
what happens, we are in this together.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Not taking any one’s word, Mimi looked both up
and down the hall herself. Then grabbing Betsy’s
hand she jerked her over the threshold of Tumble
Inn to the middle of the corridor. They walked by
the second door of their suite as if they had never
seen it before.</p>

<p class='c010' >When they were halfway to the turn, they heard
Chloe and Sue giggling behind them.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Go back, meanies,” Betsy hissed. “Do you want
to get us caught?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Yes,” Sue hissed back. “If you’re caught before
you get out we could say we were playing. Afterwards,
well&mdash;it’s your funeral, but don’t say we didn’t
warn you.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi wavered but Betsy walked determinedly
ahead and Mimi was soon in step with her again.</p>

<p class='c010' >If they could get downstairs without being seen,
they were temporarily safe. At least Mimi could
breathe deeply then. She had to hold to the rail
to keep from stumbling in her floppy shoes and heavy
skirts. This was harder than high heels and a junior
bridesmaid’s dress, only then she couldn’t hold to the
bannister. Betsy clutched her arm. She dared not
speak. Someone was coming up stairs. They would
meet on the landing. It was too late to flee.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Don’t let it be Mrs. Cole. Don’t let it be Mrs.
Cole.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi was concentrating again.</p>

<p class='c010' >The girls separated to single file, Mimi two or three
steps ahead. She held her head down and as far to
one side as she dared, but she was rolling her eyes
frantically to see who was coming up. It wasn’t Mrs.
Cole. She was sure of that now, but it was someone
she knew. It was Olivia!</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi’s first thought was to stop her and confess
and pledge her to secrecy. Her second thought was
better. She would test her disguise. Slow feet
stepping down, down, down. Hurried feet stepping
up, up, up. They met. Olivia brushed past and
did not recognize either of the girls. Mimi breathed
easier. However, it wasn’t a fair test, for Olivia was
mumbling: “The drawbridge dropped with a surly
clang, and over it a charger sprang, bearing the maiden
knight, Sir Launfal.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi should be studying too. She had memory
work piling up again.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Olivia didn’t know us,” Betsy was whispering with
a sigh of relief. “You go on out and walk slowly
and I’ll catch up with you before you get out the
drive.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Her pulse pounding, her whole body smothered
with excitement and borrowed clothes, Mimi edged
her way through the half dozen or more servants
and opened the door. True, they eyed her queerly
and one large negress snickered out, but if they knew
anything was amiss, they did not tell. They had seen
stranger “goin’ ons” than this in the years they had
worked for the school girls.</p>

<p class='c010' >As badly as she wanted to run, Mimi shuffled along
slowly until Betsy was beside her. Then quickening
their gaits, they left the campus behind and turned
down College Avenue toward town.</p>

<p class='c010' >“We did it!” Mimi exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Don’t crow yet.” Betsy cautioned. “Let’s get off
this main street. The chemistry prof lives two blocks
down.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Silently they turned down a side street; Mimi
recognized it immediately. This was the way the
taxi driver had brought her to Sheridan. That day
seemed so far away now. It was as if all her life
had been lived on a Sheridan schedule.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Now, whew!”</p>

<p class='c010' >Betsy relaxed.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Omigosh! That’s the longest short distance I
ever traveled.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Now that we are out, what are we going to do?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Go to the picture show and sit in the balcony.”</p>

<p class='c010' >When Mimi said, “O. K.” she did not realize that
they were going to the one place they would be most
likely to be caught. When she realized it later, she
shuddered.</p>

<p class='c010' >The girl at the ticket window stared at them with
open curiosity, but since neither betrayed the slightest
facial emotion, the girl did not comment.</p>

<p class='c010' >In the semi-darkness of the lobby, Mimi felt safe
for the first time since leaving Tumble Inn. Groping
up the steps to the balcony, they giggled and
giggled. When they were seated and when their
eyes were adjusted to the light, Betsy punched Mimi
and pointed. Two rows in front of them were five
Preps and a <i>faculty chaperon</i>!</p>

<p class='c010' >The culprits slid down in their seats. Suppose?
No, don’t! Nothing to do but watch, and when the
other Preps left, pull hats down and duck heads.
Keeping one eye on everyone who went out was very
distracting. This was one show Mimi could not tell
about afterwards. They had stayed through practically
all of it before the other Preps left, and the
faculty member, to their immense relief, passed without
seeing them.</p>

<p class='c010' >When the great Garbo posed in the open window
and let her hair fall forward half hiding her face,
Mimi punched Betsy.</p>

<p class='c010' >“This is where we came in.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Sh-sh-sh.” Betsy cautioned.</p>

<p class='c010' >Then Mimi heard the familiar voices too. From
the rear, her hat was knocked over on her nose.
Sheridan girls chaperoned by Mrs. Cole were filling
the row behind them. Mrs. Cole was sputtering and
giving orders regardless of the fact that she was disturbing
the entire balcony. Mimi and Betsy froze
to their seats. No matter what happened, they could
not leave now. Without speaking to each other, they
agreed to stay still until these girls saw the show and
left.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi never knew how long a show could be until
she sat through this one the second time. Betsy
despaired and went to sleep! How could she? Every
nerve in Mimi’s body was taut. Suppose? No,
don’t. Why had she ever come? Why didn’t she
think how heartbroken Mother and Daddy would
be if she were suspended? If she did get back to
Sheridan and slip in without being caught she would
never, never be so foolish again. <i>Never!</i></p>

<p class='c010' >What time was it now? It must be late. Two
o’clock plus two whole shows. Omigosh! Suppose
they were absent from supper? But if Mrs. Cole
and her girls were there, Mimi and Betsy would be
too. Giving them only a two-minute start, the culprits
flung caution to the wind and ran for the side
street. It was almost dark.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Let’s phone Chloe and Sue to meet us at the back
of the campus with our uniforms.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Never,” Betsy snapped. “Don’t you know we
couldn’t talk to them without giving our life history
first. Then someone would likely listen in. There
is always the chance that one is phoning for a boy and
making a date. No,” Betsy decided, “the only way
back in is the way we came out. Let’s cut across.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Every minute counted. Provided they got back
in, they had to change clothes before they could go
to supper.</p>

<p class='c010' >When they reached the edge of the campus, Sue
and Chloe rushed up. They were all but hysterical.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Thank heavens, you’re back. We’ve been worried
to death.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Out of our way. We never saw you before,”
Betsy said without slowing up.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Run lay our uniforms out so we can get dressed.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“You have six minutes,” Chloe said as she and
Sue sped to Tumble Inn. Anything to help.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Please let me get in safely,” Mimi prayed under
her breath. “I’ll never slip out again. I’ll study
the&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class='c010' >Before she finished praying she was safely through
the door and running down the hall. If she met
anyone, she did not remember. She was inside again.
She had not been caught.</p>

<p class='c010' >Study hall that night was a haven. Relieved and
safe again, Mimi pored over her books. For several
days to come, she had perfect recitations.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVIII' class='c008'>CHAPTER XVIII<br /> <br />THE HORSE SHOW</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009' >What proved to be one of the happiest weeks Mimi
spent at Sheridan had a fearful beginning. When she
dashed in the post office between classes to see if she
had a letter from Germany, the disappointment of
not finding one was enough. On top of that, there
was a note asking Mimi to come to Dr. Barnes’ office
at one o’clock!</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi crushed the notice. After all, they had not
slipped in Saturday unobserved. Perspiration popped
out on her forehead and around her mouth. Mimi,
who usually danced through life on her tiptoes expecting
“sprises,” had her head bowed in misery.
There was no time to wail. She was late to geometry
now.</p>

<p class='c010' >After a miserably forty-five-minute class period
during which she broke her recent perfect recitation
record, Mimi fled to College Hall and confided in
Dit.</p>

<p class='c010' >“We didn’t intend anything terrible, Dit; honest
we didn’t. We just wanted to slip out to see if it
could be done.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Don’t look so woebegone, Mimi. Your guilty
conscience is torturing you. Dr. Barnes may want
something entirely different. I shouldn’t mention the
summons to anyone if I were you until I found out
what it was. In case it is a punishment, don’t worry.
Don’t cry. Just look out the window and watch the
green grass grow.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Watch the green grass grow.” So that’s what the
college girls meant. Mimi had heard the expression
a dozen times.</p>

<p class='c010' >“After all Dr. Barnes won’t put you in stocks or
tickle your feet or cut off your ears. Let him fume
until he gets tired and then he’ll let you go.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Bolstered by Dit’s encouragement, at one o’clock,
Mimi knocked timidly on the door of Dr. Barnes’
private office. He had not come back from lunch
so his secretary asked Mimi to wait. Mimi wanted
to ask her why she was summoned, but her tongue
stuck tightly to the roof of her mouth each time she
tried to speak. Mimi teetered on the edge of the chair.
She couldn’t be still yet. She never touched the
chair back. With great effort she tore her mind from
prospective punishment. She tried to think of rainbows
or balloons, but there was no beauty for her
now. For the first time, thinking “Hojoni” failed.</p>

<p class='c010' >While she sat here, Chloe, with special permission
to miss English and gym, was being photographed for
the beauty section of the Annual. While many envied,
no one questioned her place. She really was the most
beautiful Prep. Already Sue had had her picture
taken with both the orchestra and the glee club.
Betsy’s would be with the soccer, as well as the basket
ball, team. Oh dear! Mimi’s woes were increasing
with every thought. Why had she broken her nose
when she knew she could have been on the basket ball
team? There was still tennis, but the tournament
was three weeks off and the pictures for the Annual
were being made now!</p>

<p class='c010' >“Thank you for coming promptly, Miss Mimi,”
Dr. Barnes said as he entered briskly and hung his
hat on the stand in the corner behind his desk. “I
have three things to speak to you about and I do not
want you to be late for your one-thirty class.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Three things! Mimi swallowed hard. She hadn’t
been that naughty!</p>

<p class='c010' >“First,” Dr. Barnes was saying, “you will be glad
to know that I recently had a most interesting letter
from your father. He asked me to tell you that I
was sending him a copy of our complete record of
Clorissa. Being a close friend of Chloe’s Aunt
Marcia, I was able to send him much information not
on our records. All of this is strictly without precedent
and must not be mentioned outside this office.
Do not tell even Clorissa.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Dear Dr. Barnes. He was helping, too. Why
had she been so afraid? If he were a close friend of
Aunt Marcia’s, then she could not possibly, by any
stretch of imagination be Freida; that was out.</p>

<p class='c010' >“There are <i>two</i> more things yet,” her guilty conscience
whispered, but Mimi wouldn’t listen. How
nice to talk to someone about Daddy, and about Chloe,
the problem nearest her heart.</p>

<p class='c010' >“What time is your last class?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I have gym from two-forty-five to three-thirty,
sir.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“You are excused from it this afternoon. You may
receive a caller in the south parlor at three o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Dr. Barnes!”</p>

<p class='c010' >Dr. Barnes twinkled behind his glasses and funny
little wrinkles of fat made rolls above his ears and
below his bald spot. He had been asked not to tell
who the visitor was and Mimi could not worm the
name out of him. Only the importance of the third
thing he was telling now could have saved Mimi
from her elephant-child’s curiosity.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I have been finding out things about you, Miss
Mimi.”</p>

<p class='c010' >It was coming now&mdash;why had her feet ever strayed
from Hojoni&mdash;&mdash;. But Dr. Barnes looked proud and
not aggrieved.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Rumors have been coming to me of what an excellent
horsewoman you are. The Bridle Club
here&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi put up her hand. Stop, Dr. Barnes. Are
my ears deceiving me? Wait until this much soaks
in.</p>

<p class='c010' >Dr. Barnes mistook her flushed face and raised hand
as a gesture of modesty and embarrassment.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Don’t be too modest. We are glad to know Sheridan
has someone who can represent us worthily in the
annual Spring Show of the Bridle Club. I have arranged
for you and four other Sheridan students to
be entered. There are several good mounts available.
Beginning tomorrow and at three-thirty every afternoon
the rest of the week you will go to the Club
stables and be coached for the events you are to enter.
Some faculty member will chaperon you.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Let Miss Bassett,” Mimi interrupted. Why had
she ever quaked in her boots when Dr. Barnes’ name
was mentioned? He was kindly and human as could
be, not an ogre at all.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Do you like my plans, Miss Mimi?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“They’re precious, perfectly precious!”</p>

<p class='c010' >That was the most Mimi could say for anything.
She must get out of this office quickly and whistle between
her teeth, or clog or jump up and crack her
heels together twice before landing or she would explode
right before Dr. Barnes. She forgot about her
visitor until she was seated in Spanish class. No
chance to tell any of her news. She stood it as long as
she could, then scrawled headlines and held up her
notebook so that Sue could read three rows away:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>AM RIDING FOR “S” IN HORSE SHOW</div>
    <div>COMPANY AT THREE. HOTCHA!</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010' >Sue grabbed a pencil.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>WHO?</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010' >La profesora was looking, so Mimi shook her head.
Besides, what could she say? She didn’t know herself
who was coming. Whoever it would be, they would
find her looking her best.</p>

<p class='c010' >When the two-forty bell rang, Mimi dashed up to
Tumble Inn and put on a clean uniform. Then she
cleaned her nails and put some lotion on her hands.
Now for her hair. A pat here and a pat there. At
three o’clock sharp, looking like a typical Sheridan
girl, Mimi entered the south parlor.</p>

<p class='c010' >A youth was standing facing the fire, his back to the
door. In spite of the fact that he had grown since
last summer, and regardless of what angle she
glimpsed him&mdash;back, front or side&mdash;Mimi would
recognize him.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Honky!” she cried. “You’re the last person I
ever expected to crash this gate!”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Mimi, hello!”</p>

<p class='c010' >She extended both her hands to him as they met in
the center of the room. It was the way she had seen
Miss Jane greet Dick.</p>

<p class='c010' >“It’s great to see you and not nice to ask questions
but I have to know this minute <i>why</i> you’re here.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Well, Dad had business in Nashville and I egged
him on to bringing me. This morning, as I had hoped,
he saw he’d have to stay overnight, so I asked him
for the car and drove on over here. We were afraid
I couldn’t see you so Dad phoned Dr. Barnes long
distance and he said I could come ahead.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“How is the gang? Gee! I missed you all Christmas!
When have you seen Cissy? Von? Has King
been ridden any this winter? Oh, Honky! I’m
going to ride in a horse show Saturday!”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Not so fast, lady, not so fast.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi chattered away and Honky followed as best
he could. She remembered to thank him politely for
helping fix her Christmas box. Once again when she
was on the verge of telling the great mystery about
Chloe, she was saved. Sue, Chloe, and Betsy came
in, arm-in-arm. Sue broke loose to shake hands with
Honky and to introduce the suite mates. Then her
questions began.</p>

<p class='c010' >Before they had half finished “pumping” Honky,
or before near as many girls as wanted to had passed
the open doors and looked in, Mrs. Cole sailed in erect
in her stiff skirt tails and suggested that Honky call
again sometime.</p>

<p class='c010' >“In other words, here’s your hat; now what’s your
rush?” Mimi giggled when Mrs. Cole sailed on by.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Can’t you walk out to the car with me, Mimi?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Why, yes, I will anyway.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Was she glad she went!</p>

<p class='c010' >She came back in with an arm load. Honky gave
her a big box of candy&mdash;not chocolates in a fancy
box&mdash;but a whole carton of assorted five-cent candy
bars. He knew Mimi liked them better and that they
would last longer. The suit box was from Cissy.
Honky had been thoughtful enough to phone the
day before he left and when he blew his car horn on
his way out, Cissy had had the box ready.</p>

<p class='c010' >Sue had a hunch something like this might happen
so the three suite mates had waited at the door for
Mimi. As Honky drove off Mimi waved from the
steps and the three yelled from the door.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Scram, Honky,” Betsy called, but not loud
enough for him to hear, “you are keeping me from my
food!”</p>

<p class='c010' >“<i>Your</i> food,” Mimi teased. “I’m going to eat
it all myself&mdash;string, box, paper, food!”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Don’t ever <i>say</i> that,” the girls yelled.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Sure ’nough, let’s sneak up to Tumble Inn before
we open it or there won’t be a greasy spot
around.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Food!” Olivia cried, meeting them in the hall.
“I, the great gourmand, detect the presence of
delicately browned viands!”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Aw boloney!” Betsy fibbed. “Don’t you know
clean clothes come in suit boxes.”</p>

<p class='c010' >It wasn’t an outright story, but it discouraged
Olivia. When they opened the box and saw what a
real feast Mammy had prepared, they were gladder
than ever she had not followed.</p>

<p class='c010' >Six rolls of sandwiches&mdash;three tuna fish and three
pimiento cheese&mdash;a loaf of orange bread, a date loaf,
a quart jar of peach pickles, and a drained carton of
mixed pickles Mimi liked better.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi was so happy and grateful. She intended
to write Cissy that very night but she was too excited
about the Horse Show. She wished she could have
her own King to ride. She could even hurdle on him.
There were several points she intended to ask Honky
about changing gaits in the ring, but the time was too
short. At least she had sent Cissy a world of thanks
by him. That eased her mind when she delayed
writing. Until it was over, the Show was first and
foremost.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi knew that appearance counted much with the
people in the grand stand and that often judges were
influenced by applause. Therefore, she gave careful
attention to her habit. Her best outfit was black and
white. She hoped for a sunny day so that her white
gaberdine pants would not seem too out-of-season.
Her black patent leather boots shone. She punched
another hole in the belt Betsy gave her Christmas.
She brushed and brushed her derby and finally
fastened a chin strap to it. She would need her hands
for something besides grabbing for her hat. To break
the monotony of black and white and to identify her
further, she sewed a Sheridan green satin arm band
on her sleeve. She fastened her white entry number
to the green satin band.</p>

<p class='c010' >She rode hard and heeded carefully every instruction
the groom gave. The horses were pedigreed
thoroughbreds and accustomed to the show ring.
Mimi, at home in the small English saddles, gained
skill and confidence each afternoon.</p>

<p class='c010' >She was not particularly surprised when the day
of the Show she, the youngest of the entrants, won
the coveted Good Hands Cup class. Putting Morning
Star through the customary walk, trot and canter
was a cinch. Mimi felt sure that if given a chance,
he could go through them by himself. When the ten
contestants were thinned to five and Mimi with the
four remaining in the ring was asked to change mounts,
she was not disturbed. Easily she flung herself off
Morning Star and one foot in the stirrup, one hand
on the pommel, with one swing she was astride Blue
Boy. Walk, trot, canter. What a stance Blue Boy
made before the stand. Fore feet forward until he
nearly bowed. Neck arched, head high.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Steady, Blue Boy, Steady-O,” Mimi fondled.
She was erect in the saddle but her voice was easy and
lazy.</p>

<p class='c010' >Blue Boy walled his eyes at the judges as they
walked around him but he did not flinch.</p>

<p class='c010' >After a brief conference in which the judges compared
notes, the head field judge stepped up to Mimi
on Blue Boy.</p>

<p class='c010' >With all the grace in the world Mimi accepted the
cup and the blue ribbon. With the latter between
her teeth, the cup held high in one hand, Mimi
cantered past the grand stand and out of the ring.</p>

<p class='c010' >The cheers of the Sheridan rooters followed her.
This was the highest award a Sheridan girl had ever
won in a Bridle Club show. For this, Mimi would
have&mdash;not a picture smothered in a club or team or an
orchestra&mdash;but a whole page picture mounted on
Blue Boy in the Annual. She hoped it would be opposite
Chloe’s. Since they had lived together all
year it would be dandy to have their pictures next
each other’s.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIX' class='c008'>CHAPTER XIX<br /> <br />THE TENNIS TOURNAMENT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009' >When Mimi pranced into Tumble Inn and did a
fan dance using her tennis racquet for a fan, Chloe
jerked something off the table and stuck it in her portfolio.
Betsy and Sue stepped between Chloe and
Mimi, making a screen.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Wouldn’t keep anything from me, would you,
pals?”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi zipped her finger across her neck making a
cutthroat gesture.</p>

<p class='c010' >Chloe paled but Sue giggled. Betsy told.</p>

<p class='c010' >“We were having a private art exhibit.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“But why can’t I see it?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“You might not appreciate it as much as we.”</p>

<p class='c010' >The elephant-child’s curiosity was on a rampage
now. Mimi, and the other girls too, knew that there
would be no peace until Mimi saw.</p>

<p class='c010' >Hesitantly Chloe slipped the paper from its hiding
place and handed it to Mimi.</p>

<p class='c010' >A tense pause, then Mimi laughed. She doubled
up and rolled over on the bed.</p>

<p class='c010' >“You’ve got me exactly, Chloe. I didn’t know you
were that good.”</p>

<p class='c010' >On the paper was a charcoal sketch of Mimi
awkwardly sprawled out on the icy lake at Wildwood.
Chloe had caught the humor amazingly well.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Why did you hide it? That’s the first time I ever
posed for an artist and I’m pleased.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“We didn’t intend for you to see it.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“What were you going to do with it?”</p>

<p class='c010' >No one answered.</p>

<p class='c010' >“What were you going to do with it?” Mimi
shouted.</p>

<p class='c010' >Still silence prevailed.</p>

<p class='c010' >Knowing all the vulnerable points, Mimi made
for roly-poly Sue and began to tickle her.</p>

<p class='c010' >“We&mdash;were&mdash;wrapping it&mdash;to&mdash;please, Mimi,
please, I’ll tell&mdash;to mail to Honky.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“You’re worse than traitors,” Mimi cried.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Hold her, Sue,” Betsy called. Snatching up the
picture, she and Chloe fled.</p>

<p class='c010' >As soon as Mimi wrenched herself free, she hunted
high and low and could not find them. They had
succeeded in making a getaway. For thirty minutes
Mimi stood guard in the post office. Then she gave
up. She had something else to look for besides two
silly girls. She had lost two of Dit’s good tennis balls
practicing, and if she didn’t find them, it would take
the rest of her week’s allowance to buy new ones.
Forty-five cents apiece. Two times forty-five was
ninety cents! Mimi ran toward the tennis courts.</p>

<p class='c010' >She had lost the first one on a hard serve. That
was all right, but losing the second had been unnecessary.
Taking Jill’s advice she had sent the second
ball after the first. That meant she had stood in the
same place and served the second ball as nearly like
the first as possible. It had gone wild, too, and disappeared
before her very eyes. She’d be glad when
her serve was under control, when she could serve
both balls hard the way Dit did. The way Mimi
served now, she batted the first one as hard as she
could, but in case it did not go in the proper court,
which was more than half the time, she eased up on
the second. She could drop an easy serve anywhere
in the court she pleased.</p>

<p class='c010' >Her game was improving. She was hopeful of
getting at least to quarter-finals in the tournament
unless she drew a crack player for her first sets. There
were not enough Preps interested in tennis for them
to have a separate tournament. Those desiring to
enter must take their chances against the college girls,
too. Mimi turned over her chances in her mind as
she went around behind the backstops and burrowed in
the leaves for the balls. She could not find them.
Goodbye ninety cents. She gave up and hurried in
for her shower bath.</p>

<p class='c010' >On the way, she poked her head in the office and
asked the girl on duty to order two Wright and Ditson
balls from Sweirs.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Come in, Mimi. We’ve been wanting to see you.
The girls have been talking so much about those
grand bean-hole beans you cooked and didn’t get to
eat, that I want the recipe.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I’m glad you liked them.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Glad <i>I</i> liked them! The whole school has been
raving about them. Don’t tell me you didn’t know?
I’ve decided that if you will write down the recipe
and the full instructions for digging the hole, etc.,
that I’ll mimeograph it and give the girls copies.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Keen!”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi was delighted. Heedless of the fact that
supper time was near, she plopped down in a swivel
chair and demanded paper and pencil. No time like
the present to get a job done.</p>

<p class='c010' >After supper the girls went to Miss Bassett’s office
and drew for their places in the tournament. Mimi
was lucky. She drew a bye. The matches were still
three days off and Mimi would have four days.</p>

<p class='c010' >She was spending all her spare time on the courts.
She watched the college girls play. She studied the
lazy, relaxed manner Dit had when she addressed the
ball; how careful she was not to “foot fault”&mdash;step
inside the base line when she served. More and
more she was understanding that points were won by
thinking the ball out of the opponent’s reach rather
than by “main strength and awkwardness” as the
adage goes.</p>

<p class='c010' >She was developing an effective base line drive and
Dottie would never recognize her serve. Wait ’til she
got back to B.G. She’d make them sit up and take
notice.</p>

<p class='c010' >The first day of the tournament, Mimi led small
groups on the side lines in cheers. The preliminaries
were not very interesting as the competition was not
keen. Dit mowed her opponent down without getting
up a sweat. A free-for-all tournament had to get
well under way before the players were fairly matched.
Mimi and her group moved from court to court where
the matches were the hottest.</p>

<p class='c010' >Not playing that first day, Mimi kept her eyes
open and learned tournament etiquette. She also
had time to stir in her trunk and get out her white
linen shorts with the red pin stripe which she had
worn for “bests” at camp. She cut the sleeves out of
a shirt and faced the arm holes. When she appeared
on the courts for her first match, she could hear girls
complimenting her costume. Then before them all,
she pulled a navy bandana from her pocket and tied
her hair back. She thought of Dottie’s beloved red
bandana at camp and smiled. She wished Dottie and
the other campers were here to root for her. However,
she had a group of supporters&mdash;Madge, Olivia,
Chloe, Sue and enough others to make considerable
noise were huddled on the side lines of the number
two court where she played and won her first match.</p>

<p class='c010' >She won again next day and for three straight days,
she moved up a bracket. This landed her in the
quarter-finals. She couldn’t wait any longer to tell
how well she was doing so she wrote Honky and
Dottie both. If she had not written before the
quarter-final match, she would not have written at
all, for she was defeated.</p>

<p class='c010' >At least Mimi did not cry like Jill did when she was
defeated. Nor did she accuse her opponent of
cheating. She was defeated fairly and squarely and went
down smiling. She was pitted against a college girl
who played rings around her.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi was licked before the set was called. The
girl across the net from her was taller, stronger and
a far more experienced player. In the face of such
odds, Mimi battled spunkily. The few times she did
score&mdash;oftener by her opponent’s poor playing rather
than her own good playing&mdash;Olivia and the other
rooters whooped loud and long.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi hated to lose at anything but when Sue put
a sweater around her at the end of the match, she
knew she had done her best.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Nice match, girls,” Miss Bassett said in passing.</p>

<p class='c010' >That helped but something else helped more.</p>

<p class='c010' >The day Mimi lost out, Dit moved up to semi-finals.
The next day she advanced another bracket
and the day she played in the finals the whole school,
faculty and all, turned out. Mimi had far more than
half of them marshalled in her section to cheer for
Dit. Sometimes she was so enraptured watching Dit
serve and volley and chop that she forgot to yell.
Someday she would be able to play like Dit. Dit was
no happier than Mimi when after three grueling sets
she was declared winner.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi rushed up with her white sweater and threw
it around Dit’s shoulders, shouting her congratulations.
She took Dit’s racquet from her perspiring
hands and put it in the brace. Then she retrieved the
balls and put them in the box before joining
the procession which trailed Dit in to the showers.</p>

<p class='c010' >The morning the trophies were awarded in assembly,
Mimi scrambled for a front seat. She didn’t
want to miss a word. She knew she would be able to
hear Dr. Barnes and Miss Bassett no matter where
she sat, but she wanted to hear what Dit mumbled.
Some day she would be winning a tournament and she
wanted to know how to accept it. When Dit said,
“thank you,” and reached out her hand for the
trophy, Mimi tingled to the tips of her toes.</p>

<p class='c010' >She was even happier weeks later when the Annual
was out to make another discovery. Instead of her
picture on Blue Boy being in the beauty section by
Chloe’s, it was in the sports section opposite Dit’s.
That was even better.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXX' class='c008'>CHAPTER XX<br /> <br />ROOF GARDEN PARTY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009' >The roof garden party was not begun as the social
affair it turned out to be. In the beginning it was
strictly a business proposition. The party was an outgrowth
of a “Be Beautiful” campaign Mimi herself
started.</p>

<p class='c010' >If Mimi had known the series of exciting events
which hinged on the innocent purchase of a bottle of
mange cure, she might never have bought it. She
might have let dandruff stay in her hair and freckles
continue to splotch the bridge of her nose.</p>

<p class='c010' >What to wear at the growing-closer-every-day
Commencement affairs turned Mimi’s thoughts from
her term themes, two highly important letters from
Daddy and Mother Dear, and a reprimand from Mrs.
Cole for disturbing study hall.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I can’t wear white for Commencement and look
decent with freckles. I don’t look nice in white.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Who cares?” Sue teased. “To hear you rave, one
would think you were going to graduate, or something.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Well, I <i>am</i> going to improve my looks. Miss
Bassett was talking to us today about our hair and
nails. She said my posture had improved this year.
Beginning tonight, I am going to brush my hair one
hundred strokes every night before I retire.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Yeh, I did that once myself&mdash;once was about all.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Dog mange cure is grand for your scalp,” Madge
volunteered as the discussion became general.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Is it?” Mimi asked turning to Madge. She had
never given much thought to her personal appearance
other than cleanliness. She was always too busy doing
something. The silliest thing she ever watched
was a girl standing near the highest window, mirror
in one hand, tweezers in the other, plucking her eyebrows.
She didn’t plan to go in for that sort of
beauty; something, say, which would improve her
hair&mdash;Mother Dear hadn’t made any suggestions
about it in so long. It was getting more unruly.
She’d tried changing the part from the right side to
the left and that had only made it worse. She was
thinking of letting it grow long enough to braid so
that she could wear it like Dit’s, but the thoughts of
shedding hairpins and never finding a hat big enough
kept her from it.</p>

<p class='c010' >“What does it do to your hair, Madge?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Oh, makes it shiny and fluffy and thick and long.
I saw a picture on a box of a woman whose hair fell
from her shoulders to her knees. I had a cousin who
put mange cure on her hair and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Stop!” Sue cried. “Waste no more words.
You’ve already sold her the idea. I can tell by the
smooth and oily waves”&mdash;she made rippling motions
with her hands and arms mimicking a favorite gesture
of Mimi’s&mdash;“that the fragrance of mange cure will
soon permeate the hithertofore wholesome air of
Tumble Inn. I wouldn’t put that awful smelling
stuff on my hair for&mdash;for&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class='c010' >She gave up trying to find a word bad enough to
describe it.</p>

<p class='c010' >“But you only leave it on one night. Besides it
washes off, and furthermore, I don’t mind the odor.
It’s a good clean smell like tar.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Rave on,” Sue encouraged disdainfully. “Pretty
soon you’ll have it sweet scented as dew hung jasmine
in the rosy dawn. Blah! You’ll have Mimi believing
she can pose for the pictures in the hair tonic
ads after two trial bottles. Double blah!”</p>

<p class='c010' >Two weeks passed before Mimi had an opportunity
to buy the dog mange cure.</p>

<p class='c010' >With Commencement so near, every afternoon now
some teacher chaperoned a group of shoppers to town.
Mimi joined the first group. In order to make her
purchase before the others were ready to leave, she
left a few sups in the bottom of her chocolate malted
milk glass. Anyhow she never could get every drop
without making that vulgar zooping, sucking sound on
account of the whipped cream settling to the bottom.
She didn’t want to “strike bottom” before a chaperon.
She had done well to juggle the cherry on two straws
safely to her mouth.</p>

<p class='c010' >The chaperon watched her closely while she was
at the counter. Sometimes girls slipped notes to the
soda skeets. You can save your eyesight on me, Mimi
thought. Bumpy faced upstarts. She had no note or
no time for them. Some girls were so silly!</p>

<p class='c010' >Even after the bottle was stowed away on the top
shelf of the bathroom, school was nearly over for the
year before Mimi, Madge and several others, who
had been begged into the “Beauty School,” found
time to put it on when they were sure they would have
time to shampoo it out the following morning. In
the intervening time, however, Mimi had been using
freckle cream and brushing her hair religiously, a
hundred strokes a night.</p>

<p class='c010' >“If we don’t put it on tonight, there’s no use,”
Mimi urged. She had cornered several of the girls
after supper before they left the dining hall. The
final rush was on and rounding them up had been difficult.
“This is Friday&mdash;Sunday is Baccalaureate&mdash;Monday&mdash;too
late.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Tonight suits me,” Madge said. “I was planning
to get up early anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Me, too.” Jill agreed.</p>

<p class='c010' >All together there were six who came to Tumble
Inn for the scalp beauty treatment. Madge was more
or less in charge because she had known people who
had done this. However, Mimi had read the directions
carefully and had to get in a few words. She
could no more stay in the background than a peacock.
Center stage-front, was where she belonged and,
no matter where she began, she usually wound up
there.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Why pick on Tumble Inn, Mimi, when you are
the only one who is sap enough to smell like a
polecat?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I didn’t think of that, Sue. I’m sorry. Just
seems like that most things that happen, take place
here.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“You’re right. Things do happen here. Stick
’em up, every one of you girls! Dimes and quarters
or what have you! All donations kindly received and
accepted. While you ‘Vanities’ stars sing your ‘Stay
Young and Beautiful’ theme song I am going to prepare
a feast. Everybody who wants to eat, kick in.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Swell idea, Sue. Get plenty of dill pickles.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi was the first one to pay. She dropped a
quarter in Sue’s beret, then settled down to business.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Let’s be careful and only rub it in the parts,”
she cautioned, running a comb through Jill’s sleek
hair.</p>

<p class='c010' >They went about their work seriously. They parted
and patted and massaged. As soon as they took the
stopper out of the bottle and before they had well
begun, Chloe and Sue grabbed their noses and ran
out. Betsy weakened. She couldn’t stay out of
anything that was causing such a stir.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Next,” Mimi called, shooing Madge out and
beckoning Betsy. She put her in the chair as a barber
would and pinned a towel around her neck.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Do a good job on me and then I’ll really fix
you up.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“O. K.”</p>

<p class='c010' >The agreement was carried out. To hear Sue and
Chloe and other roommates carry on, they were all
“fixed up.” Sue passed judgment.</p>

<p class='c010' >“You can’t sleep in Tumble Inn, stinking like that.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Aw, Sue. What will we do?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Take your mattress to the roof for all I care.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Sue wasn’t serious but Mimi jumped at the idea.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Sue, you angel!”</p>

<p class='c010' >She hugged her and turned her around a time or
two.</p>

<p class='c010' >“You think of the grandest things! That’s exactly
what we will do and we’ll have a midnight feast&mdash;a
roof garden party!”</p>

<p class='c010' >There! The plans had been made that quickly.
Sue had no difficulty buying and preparing the food.
On the promise of three sandwiches, a college freshman
went to the grocery for her. The rest had been
easy. The girls who would have to sleep out were
the ones who had trouble. They couldn’t sleep on
the bare tin roof, but how could they get the mattresses
out? They figured and planned. Finally, Mimi
worked it out.</p>

<p class='c010' >There were only seven to sleep out. All right,
they would sleep crosswise; four on one mattress,
three on the other. They would take the two
mattresses out of Tumble Inn and get them out
the sitting room window onto the porch roof. Sue
and Chloe objected loudly until they heard the arrangements
made for them. Chloe was to sleep with
Madge’s roommate and Sue with Jill’s.</p>

<p class='c010' >The whole plan must be kept secret. That was
hard, almost as hard as tugging and rolling and pushing
the mattresses out. They had to wait until dark,
and from the time they were out, until she saw Mrs.
Cole’s light go out, Mimi worried for fear Mrs. Cole
would find Tumble Inn vacant and the beds torn up.
That would be too bad!</p>

<p class='c010' >There was, also, a threat of rain. If it would just
hold off until the feast was over, surely the roommates
of the beauty cult could not be so cruel as to
leave them shivering and wet. But long before the
weather changed, and for an entirely different reason,
the girls were taken from the roof, but not before
they had had a feast.</p>

<p class='c010' >Sue had done well. It was quite the swankiest
spread of the year&mdash;paper napkins if you please and
as a big special surprise, ice cream suckers. The man
had packed them in dry ice and sealed them in a
carton. They were still frozen hard when Sue
proudly passed them around.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi ate and ate.</p>

<p class='c010' >“If my pajamas had a belt, I’d surely untie it,” she
said. “If you hear a sudden noise, you’ll know what
it is&mdash;Mimi exploded! There’d be nothing but giblets
left.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Oh me,” groaned Sue. Even in pain she was
happy.</p>

<p class='c010' >After the food, there were stunts; things that could
be done without noise. Walking like Dr. Ansley.
Looking over spectacles as Dr. Barnes. Mimi and
Sue “made an elephant.” After convulsing the girls
with laughter&mdash;none of the stunts would have seemed
half so funny if they could have shrieked out&mdash;Madge
succeeded in patting her stomach and rubbing her
head at the same time. Jill, after several trials, got
her foot behind her head.</p>

<p class='c010' >They were getting too noisy. Betsy was afraid,
that any minute now, they’d be discovered and called
down. She suggested that they see who could go the
longest without laughing. Faces began to puff up.
A snort here. A titter there. Was there ever such
fun?</p>

<p class='c010' >After they had worn themselves out they talked
and talked. All the good times of the year were reviewed.
But by now, here and there a sleepy girl
was crawling to an outer edge of a mattress and going
to sleep.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi was as wide awake as the owls she had heard
at camp.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I bet I can stay awake longer than any of you,”
she wagered.</p>

<p class='c010' >As it turned out she did, but when she was speaking,
she little knew the excitement she would live through
before the sun rose again.</p>

<p class='c010' >She became so drowsy she had to stretch out. She
wouldn’t go to sleep but it would be more comfortable
lying. Just as she crossed that hazy land which lies
between wakefulness and slumber, Madge reached
over and clutched her arm.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Oh, Mimi,” she said tensely. “I&mdash;hear&mdash;them
again!”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Hear what?”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi was too far gone to realize why Madge was
frightened.</p>

<p class='c010' >“D&mdash;d&mdash;death bells!” she sobbed, her teeth chattering
with fright.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi sat bolt upright.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXI' class='c008'>CHAPTER XXI<br /> <br />DEATH BELLS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009' >“Madge?” Mimi said, putting her arm around her.
She was wide awake now. “You’re shaking like a
leaf.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I&mdash;know&mdash;it but I can’t stop. Every time I close
my eyes I hear them&mdash;thump&mdash;thump&mdash;thump. Oh
Mimi it’s awful! You don’t know unless you’ve
heard them.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“What’s up?” Betsy whispered. She scrawled
over Jill and poked her head between theirs. “Am I
missing something?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Sh&mdash;sh&mdash;” Mimi said to Betsy, but she had her
arm around Madge, patting her shoulder. “Madge&mdash;er,
Madge doesn’t feel well.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Sumpthin’ she et?” Betsy asked with small boy
impudence.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I wouldn’t make fun of you! I’d b-b&mdash;be
ashamed!”</p>

<p class='c010' >She was sobbing in earnest now.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I’m sorry, Madge. I was just joking. If there’s
really something the matter I want to help.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I wish you’d go back to sleep. I was about to
tell Mimi something. I won’t tell you, because
you’d laugh.”</p>

<p class='c010' >There was a thin crescent moon tonight; the stars
were shedding more light than it. The dim light
made the figures of the tired girls look like discarded
rag dolls that had been thrown helter-skelter on the
junk pile. Arms and legs tangled. A patchwork
of pajamas.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi took it all in at one glance. The pale moon
seemed to be casting a ghostly spotlight on Madge.
She was pale as the young moon and her eyes were
unnaturally bright. Mimi wondered why Madge
had to be so different from those healthy, sound sleepers;
why she was so tortured with her strange superstition?
Mimi had never heard of anything like it
before. She wouldn’t hear now unless Madge volunteered.
She wouldn’t ask or beg her to tell. Death
bells? The very name made goose bumps up her
spine.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Please, don’t you all think I’m queer, but it runs
in my family. My grandmother always heard them
when someone in our family died&mdash;I heard them
when <i>she</i> died!”</p>

<p class='c010' >Suddenly Madge put her hands to her ears and
buried her head in Mimi’s lap.</p>

<p class='c010' >“This doesn’t make sense to me,” Betsy said.</p>

<p class='c010' >“To me either. But maybe it will.”</p>

<p class='c010' >They were whispering over Madge.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi felt Madge’s body grow rigid; heard her
voice, hoarse and half choked.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class='c010' >“If she thinks she hears a bell ringing, she’s goofy,”
Betsy whispered. She tapped her forehead as she
finished and made a spinning gesture with her hands.</p>

<p class='c010' >Madge sat up as suddenly as she had flopped down.
She clutched Mimi’s wrist on one side and Betsy’s
on the other.</p>

<p class='c010' >“They’ve stopped!” she announced dramatically,
but in the same breath added piteously, “but they’ll
come back. They always do. Once they start, I
always hear them&mdash;until somebody dies.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Betsy was dumbfounded. Mimi was speechless.</p>

<p class='c010' >“What do they sound like?” Betsy asked, moving
closer to Madge. She wriggled around in front of
her and the disturbed look on Madge’s face convinced
her that whatever death bells were, Madge believed
in them heart and soul.</p>

<p class='c010' >“They don’t ring. I don’t know why they’re called
bells at all unless they started calling them that way
back when people used to toll the bell on the tower
of the church when someone died. They’re mournful
like that but more like a dull thud. When I first
used to hear them, before Granny and Mama told
me what they were, I thought someone was under the
floor thumping with the end of a broomstick or tapping
with a hammer which had a piece of cloth tied
over the hammer head. They go thump, thump,
thump, just as regular as that.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Neither Mimi nor Betsy could utter a word by now.
Mimi felt that if she moved as much as an inch
things would crack and pop or icy hands would seize
her from behind. She tried to tell herself this was
tommyrot, but look at Madge. She was holding her
head and counting again.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class='c010' >Then for a terrible minute there was silence;
Mimi’s heart was thumping loud enough to be mistaken
for death bells.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I’ll never forget the first time I heard them. We
were at Granny’s because Grandpa was sick. Mother
and I were sleeping upstairs in the room Mother had
when she was a girl. We were so tired I couldn’t go
to sleep. I tried counting sheep but it didn’t help.
Soon I heard this dull tapping, so I began to count
just for something to do. After I counted seventy-nine,
they ceased. Not another one sounded. Next
morning Grandpa was dead and he was <i>seventy-nine
years old</i>!”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Two years ago at school, I had a headache, so I
leaned my head over on my desk. I had no more
than settled down when a thump-thump-thumping
began. I shook my head but I could still hear it.
They were the clearest I ever heard. Sounded like
someone was tapping on your desk with a ruler. I
counted forty-three. That afternoon we had a telegram
that my uncle had been killed in an automobile
wreck and he was <i>forty-three years old</i>.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Don’t ever count fourteen!” Mimi giggled. She
was so scared she was getting silly. Ridiculous, all
of it, she kept telling herself, but every time she said
ridiculous she believed Madge’s story truer and truer.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I’d be afraid to make fun of it,” Betsy said so
seriously Mimi knew she believed Madge, too.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I used to not hear them for anyone but my family,
but I get more and more of them all the time. In the
last year I have counted them three different times
and the next day found in the paper that a person
as old as I had counted, was dead. Gee! My head
aches.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi’s common sense was returning by degrees.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I’ll get you an aspirin and then we’ll go to sleep.”</p>

<p class='c010' >She hoped she would. Right now she was more
wide awake than ever she had been since the wild cat
screamed at camp.</p>

<p class='c010' >It took a great deal of nerve for her to tiptoe across
the tin roof, climb in the window, and feel her way
across the sitting room to the bathroom. She did not
dare turn on a light until she reached the bathroom.
Click! The light was on and, in some miraculous
way, fear fled with the darkness. Mimi was almost
herself when she reappeared on the roof, aspirin in
one hand and a glass of water in the other.</p>

<p class='c010' >Madge’s head was in Betsy’s lap. She was stroking
her forehead with her finger tips.</p>

<p class='c010' >“She counted to twenty-nine while you were gone.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Betsy was weak with fright.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi lifted Madge’s weary head and gave her the
aspirin.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Now we’re going to sleep. Betsy, get over there
where you belong. Now Madge, honey, close your
eyes and rest.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi began humming softly as Mammy Cissy
would. Poor little Madge! Thank goodness Mother
Dear never let her believe a lot of old wives’ tales.
Madge was relaxing.</p>

<p class='c010' >Finally all on the roof but Mimi were quiet. She
could not get comfortable. She could not turn to
cuddle down for fear of waking Madge who had
dozed off against her. Mimi began to cramp from
being so long in such an uncomfortable position. She
sat up to ease Madge over. There was a queer light
now.</p>

<p class='c010' >Had the party lasted all night?</p>

<p class='c010' >The town clock answered. It boomed out two
o’clock. No, it wasn’t dawn. What could the light
be?</p>

<p class='c010' >Standing up slowly, Mimi tiptoed to the edge of
the porch roof. The tin roof crackled under her bare
feet but she went on toward the increasing brightness.
Climbing on the rail and leaning over, she saw.</p>

<p class='c010' >The kitchen roof was on fire!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXII' class='c008'>CHAPTER XXII<br /> <br />THE LAST OF PREP HALL</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009' >Sheridan School’s main building was shaped like a
“U.” Beginning as a three story brick building it
had grown, rather like Topsy. Wings had been
added as the school grew. The original building
which had been the old Seminary for young ladies was
now only one long side of the “U.” Mimi knew it
as Prep Hall. The back end of the original first floor
was the dining hall. The one story kitchen had been
tagged on later.</p>

<p class='c010' >She knew, too, that the whole ell of Prep Hall was
so old it was a regular fire trap. Since this was the
last year for preparatory students there had already
been talk of tearing this old ell down. Plans for remodeling
had been submitted to Dr. Barnes. As soon
as the swimming pool was finished, modernizing
Prep Hall was the next thing on the building program.</p>

<p class='c010' >For one terrifying moment Mimi stood transfixed,
holding tight to the colonial railing of the roof. She
strained forward. The smoke was rolling now. She
did not want to broadcast a false alarm. She must
be sure. When she first glimpsed the smoke she
thought the cooks might be starting breakfast fires in
the old coal ranges. Any doubt she might have had,
fled now. A blaze leaped skyward and Mimi acted.</p>

<p class='c010' >As a complete picture of his past life runs through
the mind of a drowning person, so in that frantic
moment of hesitation a complete plan of what she must
do electrified Mimi into action.</p>

<p class='c010' >Without grabbing her terry cloth robe or without
awakening the girls on the roof whom she knew were
safe for the time being, she leaped through the window.
Two things she must do and every second’s
delay could mean the loss of life and property.</p>

<p class='c010' >First she must reach the office!</p>

<p class='c010' >Through the window, out the door of Tumble Inn,
patter, patter down the hall to the first stairs. So far
so good. She knew every inch of the way. Taking
two steps at a time she reached the landing safely.
But here she stumbled.</p>

<p class='c010' >Overstepping the first step of the next flight, she
fell bumpety-bumpety-bump all the way to the bottom,
like the garbage cans in Green Cap Week. When
she was smaller she had got spankings for playing on
the stairs and bumping from top to bottom very much
like her present sitting down manner.</p>

<p class='c010' >The instant she touched the first floor, she fled to
the office. No time to count bruises now.</p>

<p class='c010' >As she feared, the office was locked. There was
only one thing to do and Mimi did it. She had to
get to the telephone. She could not waste time
fumbling in the semi-darkness for a hatchet or club.
Doubling up her first as hard as she could, she swung
with all her might and main and smashed the glass
window. The sound of shattering glass should have
awakened every sleeper but it only echoed dully
through the deserted first floor.</p>

<p class='c010' >Disregarding her smarting and stinging hand she
clutched the telephone.</p>

<p class='c010' >She did not know the number of the fire department!</p>

<p class='c010' >She knew the fire drill formation perfectly. She
could have gone out of the building from the study
hall or from Tumble Inn blindfolded. She had enjoyed
the fire drills all year. They broke into the
dreary routine. Knowing how important they were,
she had heeded and learned, every instruction; but
here was something the instructor had overlooked&mdash;the
fire station telephone number.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi was only stumped for a second, however.
She had had other and fuller instructions on what to
do in case of fire. She dialed the operator, and, with
great effort, kept her voice clear so there could be
no misunderstanding.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Operator, operator,” Mimi said. She must keep
cool and say distinctly <i>where</i> the fire was, instead
of merely yelling “Fire, Fire” as most people did
when the operator answered.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Please report a fire. Sheridan School. Prep
Hall.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Fire&mdash;Sheridan School&mdash;Prep Hall&mdash;” the operator
repeated tersely. The drowsiness left her voice
on the first word.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Right,” Mimi affirmed; then without waiting to
hang up the receiver, she flung the telephone from
her and was off on her second and more important
task. Any person, neighbor or someone out in the
country, might see the blaze and turn in the fire alarm
but she, Mimi, was the only person awake and she
was the one who must arouse the whole dormitory.
She had known this before she left the roof. She had
not wasted a step or a second. From the broken office
window she ran as fast as she could and pounded
loudly on Mrs. Cole’s door.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Mrs. Cole! Mrs. Cole,” she called loudly.
“Fire! Fire!”</p>

<p class='c010' >The instant Mrs. Cole answered she was on her way
again. With all speed, she must reach the basement&mdash;and
set off the alarm bell!</p>

<p class='c010' >The corridors were long and dark like some of
the passages in Mammoth Cave. On she ran and
then down, down, down the back flight of stairs to
the basement. With a steady hand she threw the
alarm switch.</p>

<p class='c010' >Not until after the fire was over did Mimi understand
the risk she ran. The janitor’s part of the basement
where all the bells were was <i>under the kitchen</i>!
But none of this now; she had still another task. She
must rouse the girls. She knew how soundly some of
them slept. She had seen Betsy sprawl across the
bed after a soccer game and sleep through noise which
Cissy would say was “loud enough to wake the dead.”
No one must be left asleep now. No one!</p>

<p class='c010' >As she came up the steps out of the basement she
could smell smoke. Soon the crackling and popping
could be heard.</p>

<p class='c010' >Amid all the confusion which followed Mimi
coolly and systematically raced up one corridor and
down the other, opening doors, shouting names, and
making sure all beds were empty. She did not pass
up a Prep door.</p>

<p class='c010' >Lights were appearing. Girls were clinging to each
other crying. Some grabbed armfuls of clothes as
they fled; others carried dresser drawers, or weekend
bags and were spilling things leaving a trail of
lingerie and toiletries behind. Once Mimi stumbled
in a pile of clothes which had been dropped. They
tangled her feet but she shook them free. She must
go on&mdash;and on!</p>

<p class='c010' >All was chaos. Not a single instruction which had
been given during fire drills was carried out by the
frightened girls. Startled out of their sleep by the
most dreaded cry of all&mdash;“Fire, fire!”&mdash;they were
panic stricken. To get out quickly was their only
thought. Some jumped. A few used the rickety old
fire escapes but most of them followed blindly after
the first two who had run for the stairs.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi had begun her room search on the third floor
and was working down. By the time she had reached
the third floor from the basement her heart had been
pounding wildly but she did not check her speed. The
smoke was thick as fog. It burned her eyes and
gagged her.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Gretchen, are you out?”</p>

<p class='c010' >She saw the empty bed.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Caroline, fire!”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mentally she checked off another empty bed.</p>

<p class='c010' >She was tottering now but she was nearly through.
Two more rooms and she would run outside herself.
Could she make it?</p>

<p class='c010' >Crash! Crack! Screams! Sirens!</p>

<p class='c010' >Unaware that she was the object of a frantic search
by the firemen who had glimpsed her pajama-clad
little figure racing wildly from room to room, she
finished her task. But where was the door? A great
gust of smoke enveloped her. She put her hands in
front of her and felt along blindly, but her hands
met solid walls.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I am trapped,” she cried frantically. “Help,
help!”</p>

<p class='c010' >Her breathing was becoming more and more difficult.
When panic hit her, she became tired all over.
Her legs wobbled. The arms which had flung open
fifty doors and the hands which had turned on the
alarm bell were useless now. They could not find
an exit. Her eyes were red and running and she had
squinted them to keep out the smoke until she could
not open them wide. She, who had never fainted in
her life, felt consciousness slipping away.</p>

<p class='c010' >There must be air at the floor. “I’ll lie down
till I get some oxygen in my lungs. But suppose I
can’t get up? I’d be trampled to death. Oh&mdash;oh&mdash;please
God&mdash;I must find a way out!”</p>

<p class='c010' >As the great blackness bore down on her to crush
her to the floor, it was rent by a stream of water.
Firemen were bringing their hose to play on this part
of the building and a saving stream of water came
in through the open door and sprayed Mimi’s face.</p>

<p class='c010' >There! There! A door&mdash;&mdash; Right by it all the
time and couldn’t find it. “I&mdash;can&mdash;get&mdash;out!”</p>

<p class='c010' >Wet pajamas clinging to her exhausted little body,
the knuckles of her right hand bleeding, smoked and
smeared almost past recognition, Mimi staggered
from the crumbling building.</p>

<p class='c010' >Somewhat revived by the hose bath&mdash;she had followed
the hose stream to get out&mdash;the rush of outside
air, fresh and free from smoke, cleared Mimi’s mind.</p>

<p class='c010' >The girls on the roof! How could she have forgotten
them! She had turned to re-enter the toppling
building when she was grabbed from behind.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Take it easy, kiddie.”</p>

<p class='c010' >The fireman’s voice was kind and soothing but
Mimi pulled and jerked. Feeling her resist and
believing she was out of her head from fright, he
lifted her in his arms. Mimi kicked her legs and
screamed. All eyes centered on the struggle. Mrs.
Cole rushed over and hugged Mimi, fireman and all!
She was crying.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I’m going back, I tell you!” Mimi screamed,
shoving Mrs. Cole away. “Mrs. Cole! Betsy!
Madge! Jill!&mdash;the girls on the roof!”</p>

<p class='c010' >With difficulty she sputtered out the story of the
roof garden party.</p>

<p class='c010' >“They’re safe, every one of them&mdash;they
jumped&mdash;&mdash;” Mrs. Cole wasn’t a bit ashamed of
the tears that were streaming down her pasty white
face. “You&mdash;you Mickey&mdash;M&mdash;Mimi&mdash;You are
the only one we could not find!”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Me?” She had to try hard to keep from laughing
hysterically. “I knew about the fire first. I
turned in the alarm!”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi cuddled against the fireman, and relaxed.
She was tired, so tired. Her support gave way with
her. At a sudden crash, and cries from the rear of
the building, the fireman dropped her like a hot
potato. She was safe and he was needed elsewhere.
Mrs. Cole took Mimi’s arm and led her over to where
the rest of the girls huddled in the graying dawn.
Many of them hugged Mimi. Sue and Chloe cried,
but Betsy said:</p>

<p class='c010' >“I knew you were all right but I couldn’t make
them believe me. I tried to make Sue be a hound and
ferret you out by smell. She’s so keen on that mange
cure she could have smelled it above smoke or&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Betsy, please, I can’t k-k-kid now&mdash;I’m too&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi herself was crying now.</p>

<p class='c010' >Silently the girls and resident faculty members
stood on the front lawn and watched the flames gut
the old wing of the building. Their clothes, books,
and their personal valuables were going up in flames
and they were helpless. They were glad to escape
with their lives. Only Mimi’s prompt, clear-headed
action had made that possible. They did not know
that yet, but when they did, they were deeply grateful.
Tall flames, mountains of smoke, smashing glass,
trucks pumping, great streams of water battering the
walls. A fearsome, awful spectacle.</p>

<p class='c010' >Now all heads turned the way the fireman had
run who had held Mimi. He was returning now
at a run, shouting orders to the waiting ambulance
unit. Some one was hurt.</p>

<p class='c010' >Who could it be? the girls and townspeople who
had gathered in great numbers asked each other.
Every one connected with Sheridan was safe and accounted
for, even the cooks and janitor.</p>

<p class='c010' >The ambulance men were bringing some one on a
stretcher. Police fought back the crowd and cleared
the way.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Get back, you idiots. Make room! Make room!”
Mimi could hardly keep from screaming. Daddy
had taught her long ago <i>never</i> to add to the crowd
and confusion of an accident. To help, one must go
away from it rather than toward it, if help had already
arrived. It was selfish and cruel to rush in merely to
find out what was going on, when a life was at stake.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi could not see the details and she did not move
closer to find out. Nor did she find out until the next
morning that it was other than a fireman hurt.</p>

<p class='c010' >Breakfast, which consisted of fruit, cereal and milk
served cafeteria style, because this morning Sheridan
had neither kitchen nor dining room, was in progress
when Madge edged up to Mimi. The girls were
standing in groups eating. It was hard to recognize
them in their borrowed clothes. Things the college
girls let them have swallowed most of them.</p>

<p class='c010' >“You didn’t believe me last night, did you?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“No, and I don’t now. There couldn’t be such a
thing as death bells.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“That fireman who got hurt last night was twenty-nine
years old. The morning <i>Dispatch</i> says so!”</p>

<p class='c010' >“But he’s not dead, only hurt.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“No but he’s in the hospital and he may die!”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi wavered. No, she wouldn’t believe that, but
no use to argue. Let it go. She couldn’t change
Madge and she had rather not talk about death
bells. The most horrible night of her life was over
and she would rather forget.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXIII' class='c008'>CHAPTER XXIII<br /> <br />WHEN THE SMOKE CLEARED AWAY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009' >Regardless of the fact that Mimi would rather forget
the fire and all the horror that went with it,
naturally the fire was the main discussion everywhere
she turned. Disaster and confusion all about. The
beautiful lawn ruined. Girls were buzzing. They
had been ordered to stay away from the ruins. It
would not be safe to search for things yet. That whole
side of the building was roped off. Faculty members,
grieved and busy, tried to evolve plans which
would handle the situation for three more days. This
was Saturday; on Monday, school would be out for
the year.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi herself was in a turmoil. She had not washed
her teeth this morning. That was the most pressing
problem.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I believe I’ll chew a sassafras twig like our great-grandmothers
did,” she said to Sue.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Cut me one, too, while you’re in the woods,”
Sue laughed.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi laughed back but not about the sassafras
twig. Sue was a sight on earth! She had on a sweater
that hung below her hips and a skirt that touched
her ankle bones and a pair of cast-off tennis shoes.</p>

<p class='c010' >“You look as tacky as I did the day Betsy and I
slipped off.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“You don’t look so beautiful yourself,” Sue retorted.
“At least I don’t smell!”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi had forgotten about the mange cure. It
was like eating onions or food seasoned with garlic.
You didn’t smell it on yourself. Those near you
were the ones who were offended. The clothes?
They probably did make her look comical. She hadn’t
thought of that; she had been too happy over the
fact that they were <i>Dit’s</i>. Last night, or this morning
rather, for it was daylight before the fire chief permitted
them to re-enter College Hall, the Preps had
been housed with the college girls. To Mimi’s great
joy, she was assigned to Dit’s room. Any other time
she would have been so thrilled she would have entered
turning cartwheels but not last night. That
was the closest call Mimi had ever had to real tragedy.
Dit had been darling to her. She had stood
right by her and held one hand while Dr. Ansley
bandaged the bleeding one. Then she had tucked her
in bed.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Guess I’d better ask permission right now to go
for a shampoo.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“What will you wear?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“What’s the matter with this outfit, really now,
Sue?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Nothing. Say! What’s Mrs. Cole announcing?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“We can go to town and stay for lunch!” Betsy
reported coming up to them. “All we have to do is
go in pairs and sign out and sign in just like the college
girls. I was scared to death we’d have to make
out lists of what we needed and I knew I’d never think
of it all. When I see things I need I remember.
Hurry, let’s get ready. By the time we get back
maybe they will let us claim our things which were
salvaged.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I can’t bear to think I lost my diary, my tennis
racket, my boots, the cards off my Christmas packages,
and the Hanfstaengel print just when I was
beginning to love the cherubs and enjoy living with
them.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Don’t speak of losses&mdash;&mdash;” Sue choked up. Mimi
knew she was worrying about her violin, a mellow
toned old instrument which had been in the family
five generations. There was something which could
not be replaced. Her own losses seemed trivial in
comparison.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I want to go to town, too,” some one called as
they signed up and turned to leave. “Write my name,
please.”</p>

<p class='c010' >If she had not spoken they would not have known
what name to write. At first glance, Chloe looked like
the little brother, Worry Wart, in the cartoon, “Born
Thirty Years Too Soon.” Yet as she walked toward
them, rapidly but not rushed, there was something
regal in her step and proud carriage that funny-paper
clothes did not hide.</p>

<p class='c010' >Suppose she should turn out to be a princess!</p>

<p class='c010' >The town was ready for the girls when they
arrived. The aisles in the five-and-ten-cent stores
were as jammed as they are at Christmas shopping
season. The drug stores were overrun. Dresses in
sizes 12-14-16 were selling like hot cakes. Two of
the thriftier merchants displayed signs that the four
o’clock express was bringing fresh shipments of ready-to-wear,
ordered by telephone that morning.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Good as circus day,” Mimi said as they joined
hands to try to “crash” Woolworth’s.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Let’s only buy ten cent sizes of everything,” Sue
suggested. “They’ll be plenty to last three days.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Two and a half days,” Betsy corrected. The
thoughts of going home made them all tingle with
joy.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Here’s an even better idea,” said Mimi harking
back to the business in hand. “Of course, we’ll each
have to buy a tooth brush, a comb, and a wash cloth,
but outside of those, let’s each put in a dime and buy
one tube of tooth paste, one cake of soap, one nail
file and one box of powder.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“What! The founder of a beauty cult leave powder
till last?” Sue teased. “But that is a good
idea. Let’s.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I don’t think we should buy any clothes until we
know what was salvaged.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Don’t worry. I can’t without permission from
Aunt Marcia.”</p>

<p class='c010' >After a grand time in the ten cent store, pushing
and scrouging and getting lost from each other, the
girls separated. Betsy and Mimi went to the beauty
salon. Sue and Chloe beat them back to school by an
hour. Sue was still ready to tease about their hair
when she came out to meet them.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi never could stand to see girls who had just
had their hair set going about with it pasted flat to
their heads. She had laughed at many a one. Here
she was looking that way herself. She felt as if her
ears were sticking out a mile.</p>

<p class='c010' >“More things have happened!” Sue called from
the drive.</p>

<p class='c010' >“They must have,” Mimi said to Betsy. “Sue has
Chloe in a <i>run</i>.”</p>

<p class='c010' >She was dragging Chloe along at a trot.</p>

<p class='c010' >“They saved my violin! I knew that I had left it
in Miss Taylor’s studio for her to set a new bridge
before Baccalaureate music tomorrow, but the studio
was so water-soaked, I knew every instrument in there
would be ruined. It seems Miss Taylor sent a man
in through the window for her own violin. He
grabbed all four of the ones in there and mine was one
of them!”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Aunt Marcia is coming!”</p>

<p class='c010' >Chloe had news, too.</p>

<p class='c010' >“More parents have wired and telephoned and
many of them are arriving or have sent word they
were leaving soon. All the rooms at the hotel are
taken.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Flash!” Betsy took her turn. “Let me give you
a headline that seems to have been entirely overlooked
about this fire. All the uniforms burned up.
So help me, I never in all my life intend to put on
another.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Betsy hated uniforms worse than Mimi. She had
worn them a longer time.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Omigosh!” Sue gasped. “I nearly forgot! They
saved your trunk, Mimi&mdash;lock, stock, and barrel&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Why Sue! If you’re kidding, I’ll never speak
to you again!”</p>

<p class='c010' >Why that would be too wonderful! Of course the
cherubs weren’t in it, or her racket; but her diary was.
She’d had plenty of “undies” and hose and a dress or
two and goodness knows what else. The strangest
things get in the funniest places, especially in trunks.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Honest and truly. Don’t you remember? We
had to move it when we put the mattresses through
the window. You rolled it together and locked it
yourself. It seems the firemen and men who helped
threw out things like that. Gee! You lucky girl.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Sue and Chloe had taken part of the packages and
they were all walking up the driveway.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Doesn’t it seem queer to be using the College
entrance?” Chloe asked.</p>

<p class='c010' >Before any one answered, Jill shrieked from a second
floor window.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Mimi! Go to the office. You have a cablegram!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXIV' class='c008'>CHAPTER XXIV<br /> <br />WHO IS CHLOE?</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009' >Cablegram!</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi dropped her packages and ran for the office.
She almost fell over a workman who was busy replacing
the glass she had shattered last night.</p>

<p class='c010' >“You have a cablegram for me?” she asked Dr.
Barnes’ secretary.</p>

<p class='c010' >“One has come for you, but Dr. Barnes has it. He
is out now. He said tell you no one was ill and for
you not to be frightened. That it was about a matter
you and he had discussed privately. That is why he
wished to deliver the message; he wants to talk to
you.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Shall I wait?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I wouldn’t. Dr. Barnes is with the college seniors.
In spite of all that has happened, we hope to carry
through our Commencement as planned. He is in the
chapel watching the rehearsal for Baccalaureate tomorrow.
Come back by.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“How long?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I’d say thirty minutes, but your guess is as good
as mine.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Thirty minutes was an eternity! No use to try
to do anything else. Might as well sit here.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Coming back next year?” the secretary asked
Mimi. She had completed reservations for three
girls since Mimi had been waiting.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Not next year. I can’t. I don’t graduate. I’m
just a second year Prep.” Not because she wanted
to be impudent but because she was on the verge of
exploding she added: “If Dr. Barnes doesn’t come
in pretty soon I won’t be in <i>any</i> school. I’ll be ‘dead
and buried behind the old church door.’”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Don’t you have something you could be doing?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“No ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c010' >That wasn’t quite true but near enough.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Here, then, fold these programs. That’s right.
Like this one on top that I folded.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Being busy helped but at every footstep in the
hall she jerked upright and craned her neck. She
folded feverishly and had done a pile as high as the
big dictionary on the library desk when Dr. Barnes
arrived.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Well, well. How are you, Miss Mimi? I was
distressed for fear you would be ill after so much excitement
last night, or I should say this morning
early.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“I am fine, thank you, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Please, Dr. Barnes. <span class='sc'>Please!</span> Hurry!</p>

<p class='c010' >“You were a brave girl, Miss Mimi. Now I hope
that this news will not prove too much excitement
for you, coming as it does right on top of the fire.”</p>

<p class='c010' >He had the message in his hand. If he didn’t read
it or let her have it at once, she would <i>have</i> to jerk
it from him. Slower than a snail, a sloth, molasses
in January&mdash;slower than all the slow things in the
world put together, Dr. Barnes adjusted his glasses
and cleared his throat.</p>

<p class='c010' >“The message is from your father in Leipzig. But
here&mdash;you may read it for yourself.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Her breath bated, her eyes dancing, Mimi took
the paper.</p>

<p class='c010' >“PATIENT PROVED TO BE YOUR FRITZ.
FULL DEATH-BED CONFESSION. I KNOW
WHO CHLOE IS. FINE FAMILY NOW DECEASED.
KEEP SECRET. MOTHER AND
JUNIOR DOCK JUNE FIFTH. LOVE
DADDY.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Chloe was somebody! As if she hadn’t known!
“Mother and Junior are coming home! Oh, D-d-doctor
Barnes!”</p>

<p class='c010' >“There, there, child,” He rose from his desk and
came around and patted her head. What a dear he
was! “I was afraid it would be too much for one
little girl to save her schoolmates from fire and to
solve a mystery all in one short day’s span.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“That smoke nearly p-p-put my eyes out&mdash;I’m
all right.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“You certainly are. You are one of our finest
girls. Shall we send for Chloe and let her hear the
things I have to say?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Please, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Dr. Barnes picked up his telephone and asked that
Chloe be sent down.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Dr. Barnes, Betsy and Sue know that Chloe is
adopted and that she was kidnaped. They are the
only other girls in school who do. They will be so
happy to know who Chloe is, could we send for them,
too? I’d rather they knew it all now and get it correctly
than have to tell them later&mdash;because I would
tell them&mdash;and maybe, get it twisted. Chloe wouldn’t
care.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Perhaps you are right, Mimi.”</p>

<p class='c010' >He lifted the receiver again. As it clicked back
in place, his secretary entered.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Excuse me, Dr. Barnes. Miss Marcia Madison
is here and I thought you would wish to see her at
once.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“By all means. Invite her in.”</p>

<p class='c010' >He moved toward the door to welcome her. Mimi’s
eyes followed his every move.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi had not pictured her like this. The few
snapshots Chloe had showed her were very misleading.
Aunt Marcia was attractive! She was tall,
erect, stately. Mimi liked her tailored sheer navy
blue ensemble. She wore her clothes with that air
of assurance well-groomed people have. She was so
much more alive and animated than Mimi had expected.
Her voice, as she talked to Dr. Barnes, was
low and refined. Only her face showed that she had
known great sorrow and loneliness.</p>

<p class='c010' >“George! It’s lovely to see you! You look quite
fit I was afraid this terrible fire would have you
dreadfully upset and you’d have no time for visitors.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“You look charming yourself, Marcia. You
timed your arrival perfectly. I have sent for your
niece. She will be here any moment.”</p>

<p class='c010' >It’s like a play Mimi thought. All the characters
rushing on for the finale.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Since I wrote asking your permission to send Dr.
Hammond certain information, many things have developed.
If you will read this,”&mdash;he held out the
cablegram&mdash;“you will be prepared for what is coming.”</p>

<p class='c010' >She had barely skimmed it when Chloe, Sue and
Betsy entered.</p>

<p class='c010' >“You funny little tramps!”</p>

<p class='c010' >Aunt Marcia was laughing at their borrowed
clothes. She kissed her own little tramp and hugged
the others in turn, Sue first because she knew her.
Mimi, who had risen from her chair and stood quietly
by it ever since Aunt Marcia entered, went over for
her hug, too.</p>

<p class='c010' >Gee! Aunt Marcia smelled sweet! She was
sweet Mimi knew for sure before the conference
ended.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Chloe!” Mimi burst out. “Daddy did it! He
has found out who you are! He found the kidnaper!”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Who&mdash;am&mdash;I?”</p>

<p class='c010' >Chloe’s dark eyes burned with questions. Her face
went white with fear, then flushed red with hope. A
Mother? A Daddy like the other girls!</p>

<p class='c010' >“Your mother and father are dead, and as far as
we know you have no brothers or sisters; but Daddy
says you are from a fine old family!&mdash;And girls!
My very own Mother Dear and Junior <i>are coming
home</i>! They’ll dock June fifth.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Strange, how even grown people stood back and
let Mimi do all the talking. But she put her whole
heart and soul into every word she spoke and that
made people like to hear her.</p>

<p class='c010' >“My&mdash;parents&mdash;dead! Then I’ve waited too long
to find them? Oh, Mimi&mdash;oh, Aunt Marcia&mdash;&mdash;!”</p>

<p class='c010' >“You still have me, dear!”</p>

<p class='c010' >Aunt Marcia crushed the forlorn little girl in her
arms&mdash;this beautiful girl who this morning in her
ill-fitting clothes looked much more like a neglected
little orphan than that day when Aunt Marcia had
taken her from the Home. Aunt Marcia’s white
kid gloves, the white gardenias, her white purse, none
of the fresh white accessories which set off her navy
ensemble, mattered. She held Chloe tightly. She
would never let her go. Next year she would not
even let her go away to school. They would be great
chums. She had never realized before that this
beautiful girl was as love starved and lonely as she
herself. She would make up to her for all the happy
family life each had missed.</p>

<p class='c010' >Every one in the room felt what Aunt Marcia was
thinking. Betsy and Sue had their eyes fixed on their
toes.</p>

<p class='c010' >Dr. Barnes lifted his gentle eyes as if he were praying.
A tear rolled from beneath his glasses and he
made no move to wipe it away. Mimi had no words
left. She felt the way she did at church during Communion
service, small and helpless as a mere speck of
a speck and yet large as the great universal spirit of
love. Such moments caught and held her. From
them, each time, the magic trail of beauty unfolded
anew and led into a happier world.</p>

<p class='c010' >Her own Daddy had brought about this never-to-be-forgotten
moment. She took no thought of the
part she had played in the solution of the crime. Her
Daddy! And with the next thought the tension
broke. Mother and Junior coming home when she
hadn’t had the faintest idea they’d be back before
fall. Here came the tears! The spell was broken.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Why do I cry&mdash;w-when I’m so happy?” she
blurted out.</p>

<p class='c010' >“We all do that, Mimi. Tears are our safety
valve.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi turned to him as he spoke and saw Dr.
Barnes take the white handkerchief from his coat
pocket and wipe under his glasses.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Shall we sit down? We still have much to say
to each other.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Sue and Betsy squeezed into one chair. Aunt
Marcia sat across the desk from Dr. Barnes and, although
Aunt Marcia knew “young ladies” instructed
by Mrs. Cole did not sit on the arms of chairs, she
pulled Chloe down on the arm of hers. After Dr.
Barnes decided that Mimi intended to remain standing,
he seated himself.</p>

<p class='c010' >Sit down? Not to save her life.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Shall I begin with my first letter to Daddy?”
Mimi asked Dr. Barnes.</p>

<p class='c010' >“No&mdash;contrary to my first idea, I think I shall
begin this story. I forget that you girls, and Chloe
herself, do not know many things I do.”</p>

<p class='c010' >All eyes focused on Dr. Barnes.</p>

<p class='c010' >“More years ago than I care to count, but it was a
year or two before most of you girls were born, I did
the hardest thing I have had to do in my entire life.
My superior officer, Captain Bill Harrison, who was
my friend as well as commander, lay mortally
wounded in a shell hole in no man’s land&mdash;Marcia,
please excuse me if this is difficult for you but I want
these girls to know you as I do&mdash;I had dragged him
there during a lull in the bombing. Both of us were
wounded; I slightly, Bill fatally. ‘I’m going on&mdash;old
man,’ he gasped. From the light of a rocket
which flared above us I could see his agony and knew
that he was telling the truth. He was trying to take
something out of his pocket but he was too weak. I
unbuttoned his stained uniform and drew out a picture
of Marcia.” Dr. Barnes reached across the desk
and patted Aunt Marcia’s gloved hand. She had
a far away look in her eyes but she was erect and
smiling faintly. “I held it up before his clouded
eyes&mdash;‘Darling&mdash;See her Barney&mdash;and tell&mdash;her&mdash;I
love&mdash;&mdash;’ But he had gone on before he finished. A
year later I brought his effects and message home to
a gallant lady.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Dr. Barnes had to wait for his throat to relax before
he continued.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Another year passed swiftly and that same lady,
still gallant and smiling, came to me for advice. She
was lonely she said. Knowing that she would never
marry because all of that kind of love she had to give
was buried in Flanders, she discussed with me her
idea of adopting a daughter.</p>

<p class='c010' >“I was with Marcia when she selected Clorissa
from the fifty children subject to adoption. You were
a lovely little thing, Chloe, and that was not your
name at all. Your Aunt Marcia renamed you and
gave you her own last name of Madison. You held
out your tiny arms and ran out from the line of children
as if you were expecting a beautiful lady to take
you in her arms. When you were nearer, however,
you stopped and hung your head, but you had
touched Marcia’s heart. She wanted none of the
children so much as you. The record showed that
you had been left inside of the wall of the home and,
when found by a nurse, you were leaning against a
tree sobbing. There was a note tied to your wrist
stating that your father had been deported and that
your Aunt would come someday from the old country
to claim you. This story was credited and recorded,
but two years had passed and no word had come so
you were placed on the list for adoption. These are
the things I wrote your father, Mimi.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Not even Mimi spoke.</p>

<p class='c010' >Dr. Barnes had woven a spell over his hearers.
Chloe, although she strained forward and clenched
her hand on Aunt Marcia’s arm tighter, uttered no
word. It was as if she were listening to a gripping
story about some one else.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Shall <i>I</i> begin now?”</p>

<p class='c010' >“Yes, Mimi, but I wanted you girls to know as
much as possible. There is still much to unravel.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“My story will be brief,” Mimi began. “I wrote
my Daddy the little Chloe had told me. Daddy
answered sympathetically but figured there was nothing
he could do. Then a most peculiar thing occurred.
Daddy was called to see a sick man in the
slums of Leipzig. At first he was merely another patient,
a big fellow who was slowly dying of an incurable
malady. The second time Daddy was called
the man was delirious&mdash;he muttered and cursed some
one called Freida. At the name Freida something
inside Daddy clicked. He knew the man had lived
in the United States. When he rolled up the man’s
ragged sleeves to give him a hypodermic to quiet his
raving, he saw the man’s arms were <i>tattooed</i>! That
in itself was not unusual but it dovetailed perfectly
with what Chloe had told me. Daddy asked the
man’s friends a few questions. When he got home he
wrote me for more details. In the meantime Chloe
described the tattooed pictures. One day Daddy
dropped by to see the man and he was gone. When
my letter arrived, he searched high and low for him
and could not find him. The name had been fictitious.</p>

<p class='c010' >“The next time Daddy was called the man whom
we now know was Fritz must have been dying. By
reading the cablegram, we know Daddy somehow
managed to use the little knowledge he had, plus
his hunch that the man was guilty, and by playing the
great American game of bluff, pulled a confession
from him.”</p>

<p class='c010' >“You told me your Daddy was the best <i>doctor</i> in
the world, not the greatest <i>detective</i>,” Betsy said.</p>

<p class='c010' >“He’s <i>both</i>!”</p>

<p class='c010' >“He’s made me very happy,” Chloe declared softly.
Her head had dropped to Aunt Marcia’s shoulder.</p>

<p class='c010' >“No happier than I,” Aunt Marcia added. “Regardless
of who your parents were, you are my girl
and I love you. Now&mdash;no one can take you away
from me.”</p>

<p class='c010' >Aunt Marcia has suffered fears, too.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009' >Sunday was a full day, but Mimi was glad when it
was over. She shook hands and made curtsies off
and on all day. Meeting other girls’ parents and sisters
and brothers was fun but it was tiring. Then,
too, it made her too impatient to see her own.</p>

<p class='c010' >Sunday afternoon she slipped away quietly to say
goodbye to her favorite places. She lingered under
the big maple tree where she had studied on sunny
days. She inspected the partially completed swimming
pool as carefully as a contractor. Not next
year, but some year, she would take swimming instructions
here and she wanted it just so. She hoped
Miss Bassett would be teaching advanced swimming
when she returned. She must take another last look
at the gym.</p>

<p class='c010' >To her delight the door was unlocked and she could
enter. No doubt some faculty member had been
showing it to visitors. The big empty gymnasium
was not lonely to Mimi. She loved it. Here she had
known sorrow; but here, too, she had been happiest.
Suppose she added all the hours of free time she
had spent here practicing goals? Suppose she
had fastened a pedometer on her ankle to
record the miles she had dribbled down the floor?</p>

<p class='c010' >Am I queer that I miss places as much or more
than people, she wondered? She remembered how
it hurt to say goodbye to the friendly trees at camp,
the Lodge, the river, the hills. When she thought
back about camp, it was these things she longed for.</p>

<p class='c010' >She’d be the same way about Sheridan. In the
long summer days ahead she would miss the window
ledge in the gym where she had perched to rest, the
atmosphere of Tumble Inn; and now since it had
been the scene of such violent emotions, Dr. Barnes’
office was endeared to her.</p>

<p class='c010' >Because of the fire the Baccalaureate service had
been changed from morning to evening. True some
of the Prep graduates were not as well dressed as they
had planned to be, but, taken as a whole, the rows
and rows of girls in white made an inspiring picture.</p>

<p class='c010' >The Commencement program proper, at which
sheepskins were awarded to the college girls taking
degrees, and highly embossed parchment diplomas
were given to the graduating Preps, was Monday
morning at eleven o’clock. Since this was the last year
of its long existence, the Preparatory students were
given the special privilege of carrying the daisy chain.
Instead of the seniors filing in a single line carrying
the great rope of plaited flowers to pass down to the
undergraduates as had been the custom, the order
was reversed. The seventy-five girls of the Prep
department carried the daisy chain and passed it to
the college freshmen. This year the significance was
that the fine old traditions on which Sheridan Seminary
had been founded must not die. They must be
the foundation of Sheridan’s continued growth now
that she was to be a fully accredited college.</p>

<p class='c010' >Mimi felt very solemn marching along balancing
the flower rope on her erect shoulder.</p>

<p class='c010' >True to her word, Olivia the “near-child-prodigy”
took first honors with the highest average ever made
by a Prep.</p>

<p class='c010' >Sue played in the orchestra.</p>

<p class='c010' >Betsy and Mimi sat side by side.</p>

<p class='c010' >Imagine Mimi’s astonishment when Dr. Barnes,
contrary to his time-honored policy of never singling
out girls for special attention, publicly commended
her for her cool-headed bravery the night of the fire.
She was pleased but Betsy was ecstatic!</p>

<p class='c010' >Things were whirling around Mimi, but not touching
her deeply. She was absorbed in a mystery solved
and a home-coming.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Free night” before departure, when all restrictions
were off, was fun; but Mimi was impatient. Had
she been going south instead of north she could have
left Monday evening.</p>

<p class='c010' >She was all packed. Many things she had treasured
were left in ruins. She could hardly wait the
coming of daylight which heralded the arrival of the
station wagon, the rickety old bus which would rattle
up and take a load of eager girls jiggety jig to the
north-bound train.</p>

<p class='c010' >She <i>must</i> get home to help Cissy get the house aired
and ready for Mother Dear and Junior and <i>summer
visitors</i>. She had already asked both Chloe and Betsy
and they had accepted “if.” Mimi, who was never
stumped by “ifs” knew that they would come and
that there was a happy summer ahead.</p>

<p class='c010' >This took the bitter out of the goodbyes.</p>

<p class='c010' >Only once when Mimi turned away from the fluttering
hands and chorus of farewells and glanced toward
the ashes of Prep Hall, were there tears in her
eyes. She wiped them away with her bandaged
hand.</p>

<p class='c010' >After all, Sheridan was her Sheridan now and she
was coming back some day.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
